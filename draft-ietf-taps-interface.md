--- abstract

This document describes an abstract application programming interface, API, to the transport
layer that enables the selection of transport protocols and
network paths dynamically at runtime. This API enables faster deployment
of new protocols and protocol features without requiring changes to the
applications. The specified API follows the Transport Services architecture
by providing asynchronous, atomic transmission of messages. It is intended to replace the
BSD sockets API as the common interface to the
transport layer, in an environment where endpoints could select from
multiple interfaces and potential transport protocols.

# Introduction

This document specifies an abstract application programming interface (API) that describes the interface component of
the high-level Transport Services architecture defined in
{{!I-D.ietf-taps-arch}}. A Transport Services system supports
asynchronous, atomic transmission of messages over transport protocols and
network paths dynamically selected at runtime, in environments where an endpoint
selects from multiple interfaces and potential transport protocols.

Applications that adopt this API will benefit from a wide set of
transport features that can evolve over time. This protocol-independent API ensures that the system
providing the API can optimize its behavior based on the application
requirements and network conditions, without requiring changes to the
applications.  This flexibility enables faster deployment of new features and
protocols, and can support applications by offering racing and fallback
mechanisms, which otherwise need to be separately implemented in each application.
Transport Services implementations are free to take any desired form as long
as the API specification in this document is honored; a nonprescriptive guide to
implementing a Transport Services system is available {{?I-D.ietf-taps-impl}}.

The Transport Services system derives specific path and protocol selection
properties and supported transport features from the analysis provided in
{{?RFC8095}}, {{?RFC8923}}, and
{{?RFC8922}}. The Transport Services API enables an implementation
to dynamically choose a transport protocol rather
than statically binding applications to a protocol at
compile time. The Transport Services API also provides
applications with a way to override transport selection and instantiate a specific stack,
e.g., to support servers wishing to listen to a specific protocol. However, forcing a
choice to use a specific transport stack is discouraged for general use, because it can reduce portability.

## Terminology and Notation {#notation}

The Transport Services API is described in terms of

- Objects with which an application can interact;
- Actions the application can perform on these objects;
- Events, which an object can send to an application to be processed asynchronously; and
- Parameters associated with these actions and events.

The following notations, which can be combined, are used in this document:

- An action that creates an object:

~~~
      Object := Action()
~~~

- An action that creates an array of objects:

~~~
      []Object := Action()
~~~

- An action that is performed on an object:

~~~
      Object.Action()
~~~

- An object sends an event:

~~~
      Object -> Event<>
~~~

- An action takes a set of Parameters; an event contains a set of Parameters.
  action and event parameters whose names are suffixed with a question mark are optional.

~~~
      Action(param0, param1?, ...)
      Event<param0, param1?, ...>
~~~

Objects that are passed as parameters to actions use call-by-value behavior.
Actions associated with no object are actions on the API; they are equivalent to actions on a per-application global context.

Events are sent to the application or application-supplied code (e.g. framers,
see {{framing}}) for processing; the details of event interfaces are platform-
and implementation-specific, and can be implemented using
other forms of asynchronous processing, as idiomatic for the
implementing platform.

We also make use of the following basic types:

- Boolean: Instances take the value `true` or `false`.
- Integer: Instances take positive or negative integer values.
- Numeric: Instances take positive or negative real number values.
- String: Instances are represented in UTF-8.
- IP Address: An IPv4 or IPv6 address {{?RFC5952}}.
- Enumeration: A family of types in which each instance takes one of a fixed,
  predefined set of values specific to a given enumerated type.
- Tuple: An ordered grouping of multiple value types, represented as a
  comma-separated list in parentheses, e.g., `(Enumeration, Preference)`.
  Instances take a sequence of values each valid for the corresponding value
  type.
- Array: Denoted `[]Type`, an instance takes a value for each of zero or more
  elements in a sequence of the given Type. An array can be of fixed or
  variable length.
- Set: An unordered grouping of one or more different values of the same type.

For guidance on how these abstract concepts can be implemented in languages
in accordance with language-specific design patterns and platform features,
see {{implmapping}}.

## Specification of Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Overview of the API Design {#principles}

The design of the API specified in this document is based on a set of
principles, themselves an elaboration on the architectural design principles
defined in {{!I-D.ietf-taps-arch}}. The API defined in this document
provides:


- A Transport Services system that
  can offer a variety of transport protocols, independent
  of the Protocol Stacks that will be used at
  runtime. To the degree possible, all common features of these protocol
  stacks are made available to the application in a
  transport-independent way.
  This enables applications written to a single API
  to make use of transport protocols in terms of the features
  they provide.

- A unified API to datagram and stream-oriented transports, allowing
  use of a common API for Connection establishment and closing.

- Message-orientation, as opposed to stream-orientation, using
  application-assisted framing and deframing where the underlying transport
  does not provide these.

- Asynchronous Connection establishment, transmission, and reception.
  This allows concurrent operations during establishment and event-driven
  application interactions with the transport layer.

- Selection between alternate network paths, using additional information about the
  networks over which a Connection can operate (e.g. Provisioning Domain (PvD)
  information {{?RFC7556}}) where available.

- Explicit support for transport-specific features to be applied, when that
  particular transport is part of a chosen Protocol Stack.

- Explicit support for security properties as first-order transport features.

- Explicit support for configuration of cryptographic identities and transport
  security parameters persistent across multiple Connections.

- Explicit support for multistreaming and multipath transport protocols, and
  the grouping of related Connections into Connection Groups through "cloning"
  of Connections (see {{groups}}). This function allows applications to take full advantage of new
  transport protocols supporting these features.


# API Summary

An application primarily interacts with this API through two objects:
Preconnections and Connections. A Preconnection object ({{pre-establishment}})
represents a set of properties and constraints on the selection and configuration of
paths and protocols to establish a Connection with an Endpoint. A Connection object
represents an instance of a transport Protocol Stack on which data can be sent to and/or
received from a Remote Endpoint (i.e., a logical connection that, depending on the
kind of transport, can be bi-directional or unidirectional, and that can use a stream
protocol or a datagram protocol). Connections are presented consistently to the
application, irrespective of whether the underlying transport is connection-less or
connection-oriented. Connections can be created from Preconnections in three ways:

- by initiating the Preconnection (i.e., creating a Connection from the Preconnection, actively opening, as in a client; see Initiate() in {{initiate}}),
- by listening on the Preconnection (i.e., creating a Listener based on the Preconnection, passively opening, as in a server; see Listen() in {{listen}}),
- or by a rendezvous for the Preconnection (i.e., peer to peer establishment; see Rendezvous() in {{rendezvous}}).

Once a Connection is established, data can be sent and received on it in the form of
Messages. The API supports the preservation of message boundaries both
via explicit Protocol Stack support, and via application support through a
Message Framer that finds message boundaries in a stream. Messages are
received asynchronously through event handlers registered by the application.
Errors and other notifications also happen asynchronously on the Connection.
It is not necessary for an application to handle all events; some events can
have implementation-specific default handlers.

The application SHOULD NOT
assume that ignoring events (e.g., errors) is always safe.


## Usage Examples

The following usage examples illustrate how an application might use the
Transport Services API to:

- Act as a server, by listening for incoming Connections, receiving requests,
  and sending responses, see {{server-example}}.
- Act as a client, by connecting to a Remote Endpoint using `Initiate`, sending
  requests, and receiving responses, see {{client-example}}.
- Act as a peer, by connecting to a Remote Endpoint using Rendezvous while
  simultaneously waiting for incoming Connections, sending Messages, and
  receiving Messages, see {{peer-example}}.

The examples in this section presume that a transport protocol is available
between the Local and Remote Endpoints that provides Reliable Data Transfer, Preservation of
Data Ordering, and Preservation of Message Boundaries. In this case, the
application can choose to receive only complete Messages.

If none of the available transport protocols provides Preservation of Message
Boundaries, but there is a transport protocol that provides a reliable ordered
byte-stream, an application could receive this byte-stream as partial
Messages and transform it into application-layer Messages.  Alternatively,
an application might provide a Message Framer, which can transform a
sequence of Messages into a byte-stream and vice versa ({{framing}}).

### Server Example

This is an example of how an application might listen for incoming Connections
using the Transport Services API, receive a request, and send a response.

~~~
LocalSpecifier := NewLocalEndpoint()
LocalSpecifier.WithInterface("any")
LocalSpecifier.WithService("https")

TransportProperties := NewTransportProperties()
TransportProperties.Require(preserve-msg-boundaries)
// Reliable Data Transfer and Preserve Order are Required by default

SecurityParameters := NewSecurityParameters()
SecurityParameters.Set(identity, myIdentity)
SecurityParameters.Set(server-certificate, myCertificate)

// Specifying a Remote Endpoint is optional when using Listen
Preconnection := NewPreconnection(LocalSpecifier,
                                  TransportProperties,
                                  SecurityParameters)

Listener := Preconnection.Listen()

Listener -> ConnectionReceived<Connection>

// Only receive complete messages in a Conn.Received handler
Connection.Receive()

Connection -> Received<messageDataRequest, messageContext>

//---- Receive event handler begin ----
Connection.Send(messageDataResponse)
Connection.Close()

// Stop listening for incoming Connections
// (this example supports only one Connection)
Listener.Stop()
//---- Receive event handler end ----

~~~


### Client Example

This is an example of how an application might open two Connections to a remote application
using the Transport Services API, and send a request as well as receive a response on each of them.
The code designated with comments as "Ready event handler" could, e.g., be implemented
as a callback function, for example. This function would receive the Connection that it expects
to operate on ("Connection" and "Connection2" in the example), handed over using the variable
name "C".


~~~
RemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()
RemoteSpecifier.WithHostName("example.com")
RemoteSpecifier.WithService("https")

TransportProperties := NewTransportProperties()
TransportProperties.Require(preserve-msg-boundaries)
// Reliable Data Transfer and Preserve Order are Required by default

SecurityParameters := NewSecurityParameters()
TrustCallback := NewCallback({
  // Verify identity of the Remote Endpoint, return the result
})
SecurityParameters.SetTrustVerificationCallback(TrustCallback)

// Specifying a Local Endpoint is optional when using Initiate
Preconnection := NewPreconnection(RemoteSpecifier,
                                  TransportProperties,
                                  SecurityParameters)

Connection := Preconnection.Initiate()
Connection2 := Connection.Clone()

Connection -> Ready<>
Connection2 -> Ready<>

//---- Ready event handler for any Connection C begin ----
C.Send(messageDataRequest)

// Only receive complete messages
C.Receive()
//---- Ready event handler for any Connection C end ----

Connection -> Received<messageDataResponse, messageContext>
Connection2 -> Received<messageDataResponse, messageContext>

// Close the Connection in a Receive event handler
Connection.Close()
Connection2.Close()
~~~

A Preconnection serves as a template for creating a Connection via initiating, listening, or via rendezvous. Once a Connection has been created,
changes made to the Preconnection that was used to create it do not affect this Connection. Preconnections are reusable after being used to create a Connection, whether this Connection was closed or not. Hence, in the above example, it would be correct for the client to initiate a third Connection to the example.com server by continuing as follows:

~~~
//.. carry out adjustments to the Preconnection, if desired
Connection3 := Preconnection.Initiate()
~~~


### Peer Example

This is an example of how an application might establish a Connection with a
peer using `Rendezvous`, send a Message, and receive a Message.

~~~
// Configure local candidates: a port on the Local Endpoint
// and via a STUN server
HostCandidate := NewLocalEndpoint()
HostCandidate.WithPort(9876)

StunCandidate := NewLocalEndpoint()
StunCandidate.WithStunServer(address, port, credentials)

LocalCandidates = [HostCandidate, StunCandidate]

TransportProperties := // ...Configure transport properties
SecurityParameters  := // ...Configure security properties

Preconnection := NewPreconnection(LocalCandidates,
                                  [], // No remote candidates yet
                                  TransportProperties,
                                  SecurityParameters)

// Resolve the LocalCandidates. The Preconnection.Resolve()
// call resolves both local and remote candidates but, since
// the remote candidates have not yet been specified, the
// ResolvedRemote list returned will be empty and is not
// used.
ResolvedLocal, ResolvedRemote = Preconnection.Resolve()

// Application-specific code goes here to send the ResolvedLocal
// list to peer via some out-of-band signalling channel (e.g.,
// in a SIP message)
...

// Application-specific code goes here to receive the list of
// RemoteCandidates from peer via the signalling channel
...

// Add remote candidates and initiate the rendezvous:
Preconnection.AddRemote(RemoteCandidates)
Preconnection.Rendezvous()

Preconnection -> RendezvousDone<Connection>

//---- RendezvousDone event handler begin ----
Connection.Send(messageDataRequest)
Connection.Receive()
//---- RendezvousDone event handler end ----

Connection -> Received<messageDataResponse, messageContext>

// If new Remote Endpoint candidates are received from the
// peer over the signalling channel, for example if using
// Trickle ICE, then add them to the Connection:
Connection.AddRemote(NewRemoteCandidates)

// On a PathChange<> events, resolve the Local Endpoint Identifiers to
// see if a new Local Endpoint has become available and, if
// so, send to the peer as a new candidate and add to the
// Connection:
Connection -> PathChange<>

//---- PathChange event handler begin ----
ResolvedLocal, ResolvedRemote = Preconnection.Resolve()
if ResolvedLocal has changed:
  // Application-specific code goes here to send the
  // ResolvedLocal list to peer via signalling channel
  ...

  // Add the new Local Endpoints to the Connection:
  Connection.AddLocal(ResolvedLocal)
//---- PathChange event handler end ----


// Close the Connection in a Receive event handler
Connection.Close()
~~~

# Transport Properties {#transport-properties}

Each application using the Transport Services API declares its preferences
for how the Transport Services system is to operate. This is done by using
Transport Properties, as defined in {{!I-D.ietf-taps-arch}}, at each stage
of the lifetime of a Connection.

Transport Properties are divided into Selection, Connection, and Message
Properties.

Selection Properties (see {{selection-props}}) can only be set
during pre-establishment. They are only used to specify which paths and
Protocol Stacks can be used and are preferred by the application.
Calling `Initiate` on a Preconnection creates an outbound Connection,
and the Selection Properties remain readable from the
Connection, but become immutable. Selection Properties
can be set on Preconnections, and the effect of Selection Properties
can be queried on Connections and Messages.

Connection Properties (see {{connection-props}}) are used to inform
decisions made during establishment and to fine-tune the established
Connection. They can be set during pre-establishment, and can be
changed later. Connection Properties can be set on Connections and
Preconnections; when set on Preconnections, they act as an initial
default for the resulting Connections.

Message Properties (see {{message-props}}) control the behavior of the
selected protocol stack(s) when sending Messages. Message Properties
can be set on Messages, Connections, and Preconnections; when set on
the latter two, they act as an initial default for the Messages sent
over those Connections.

Note that configuring Connection Properties and Message Properties on
Preconnections is preferred over setting them later. Early specification of
Connection Properties allows their use as additional input to the selection
process. Protocol-specific Properties, which enable configuration of specialized
features of a specific protocol (see Section 3.2 of {{!I-D.ietf-taps-arch}}) are not
used as an input to the selection process, but only support configuration if
the respective protocol has been selected.

## Transport Property Names {#property-names}

Transport Properties are referred to by property names. These names are alphanumeric strings in which the following
characters are allowed: lowercase letters `a-z`, uppercase letters `A-Z`,
digits `0-9`, the hyphen `-`, and the underscore `_`. These names serve two purposes:

- Allowing different components of a Transport Services implementation to pass Transport
  Properties, e.g., between a language frontend and a policy manager,
  or as a representation of properties retrieved from a file or other storage.
- Making the code of different Transport Services implementations look similar.
  While individual programming languages might preclude strict adherence to the
  aforementioned naming convention (for instance, by prohibiting the use of hyphens
  in symbols), users interacting with multiple implementations will still benefit
  from the consistency resulting from the use of visually similar symbols.

Transport Property Names are hierarchically organized in the
form \[\<Namespace>.\]\<PropertyName\>.

- The optional Namespace component and its trailing character `.` MUST be omitted for well-known,
  generic properties, i.e., for properties that are not specific to a protocol.
- Protocol-specific Properties MUST use the protocol acronym as the Namespace (e.g., a
  `tcp` Connection could support a TCP-specific Transport Property, such as the TCP user timeout
  value, in a Protocol-specific Property called `tcp.userTimeoutValue` (see {{tcp-uto}})).
- Vendor or implementation specific properties MUST be placed in a Namespace starting with the underscore `_` character
   and SHOULD use a string identifying the vendor or implementation.
- For IETF protocols, the name of a Protocol-specific Property SHOULD be specified in an IETF document published in the RFC Series after IETF review.
  An IETF protocol Namespace does not start with an underscore character.

Namespaces for each of the keywords provided in the IANA protocol numbers registry
(see https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml) are reserved
for Protocol-specific Properties and MUST NOT be used for vendor or implementation-specific properties.
Terms listed as keywords as in the protocol numbers registry SHOULD be avoided as any part of a vendor- or
implementation-specific property name.


## Transport Property Types {#property-types}

Each Transport Property has one of the basic types described in {{notation}}.

Most Selection Properties (see {{selection-props}}) are of the Enumeration type,
and use the Preference Enumeration, which takes one of five possible values
(Prohibit, Avoid, No Preference, Prefer, or Require) denoting the level of preference
for a given property during protocol selection.

# Scope of the API Definition {#scope-of-interface-defn}

This document defines a language- and platform-independent API of a
Transport Services system. Given the wide variety of languages and language
conventions used to write applications that use the transport layer to connect
to other applications over the Internet, this independence makes this API
necessarily abstract.

There is no interoperability benefit in tightly defining how the API is
presented to application programmers across diverse platforms. However,
maintaining the "shape" of the abstract API across different platforms reduces
the effort for programmers who learn to use the Transport Services API to then
apply their knowledge to another platform. That said, implementations have
significant freedom in presenting this API to programmers, balancing the
conventions of the protocol with the shape of the API. We make the following
recommendations:

- Actions, events, and errors in implementations of the Transport Services API SHOULD use
  the names given for them in the document, subject to capitalization,
  punctuation, and other typographic conventions in the language of the
  implementation, unless the implementation itself uses different names for
  substantially equivalent objects for networking by convention.
- Transport Services systems SHOULD implement each Selection Property,
  Connection Property, and Message Context Property specified in this document.
  These features SHOULD be implemented even when in a specific implementation it
  will always result in no operation, e.g. there is no action when the API
  specifies a Property that is not available in a transport protocol implemented
  on a specific platform. For example, if TCP is the only underlying transport protocol,
  the Message Property `msgOrdered` can be implemented (trivially, as a no-op) as
  disabling the requirement for ordering will not have any effect on delivery order
  for Connections over TCP. Similarly, the `msgLifetime` Message Property can be
  implemented but ignored, as the description of this Property states that "it is not
  guaranteed that a Message will not be sent when its Lifetime has expired".
- Implementations can use other representations for Transport Property Names,
  e.g., by providing constants, but should provide a straight-forward mapping
  between their representation and the property names specified here.

# Pre-Establishment Phase {#pre-establishment}

The pre-establishment phase allows applications to specify properties for
the Connections that they are about to make, or to query the API about potential
Connections they could make.

A Preconnection object represents a potential Connection. It is a passive object
(a data structure) that merely maintains the state that
describes the properties of a Connection that might exist in the future.  This state
comprises Local Endpoint and Remote Endpoint objects that denote the endpoints
of the potential Connection (see {{endpointspec}}), the Selection Properties
(see {{selection-props}}), any preconfigured Connection Properties
({{connection-props}}), and the security parameters (see
{{security-parameters}}):

~~~
   Preconnection := NewPreconnection([]LocalEndpoint,
                                     []RemoteEndpoint,
                                     TransportProperties,
                                     SecurityParameters)
~~~

At least one Local Endpoint MUST be specified if the Preconnection is used to `Listen`
for incoming Connections, but the list of Local Endpoints MAY be empty if
the Preconnection is used to `Initiate`
connections. If no Local Endpoint is specified, the Transport Services system will
assign an ephemeral local port to the Connection on the appropriate interface(s).
At least one Remote Endpoint MUST be specified if the Preconnection is used
to `Initiate` Connections, but the list of Remote Endpoints MAY be empty if
the Preconnection is used to `Listen` for incoming Connections.
At least one Local Endpoint and one Remote Endpoint MUST be specified if a
peer-to-peer `Rendezvous` is to occur based on the Preconnection.

If more than one Local Endpoint is specified on a Preconnection, then all
the Local Endpoints on the Preconnection MUST represent the same host. For
example, their Endpoint Identifiers might correspond to different interfaces on a multi-homed
host, or their Endpoint Identifiers might correspond to local interfaces and a STUN server that
can be resolved to a server reflexive address for a Preconnection used to
make a peer-to-peer `Rendezvous`.

If more than one Remote Endpoint is specified on the Preconnection, then
all the Remote Endpoints on the Preconnection SHOULD represent the same
service, to the extent that the application and the Transport Services
system can validate that the Remote Endpoints correspond to the same service.
For example, a Remote Endpoint might represent various network
interfaces of a host, or a server reflexive address that can be used to
reach a host, or a set of hosts that provide equivalent local balanced
service.

In most cases, it is expected that a single Remote Endpoint will be
specified by name, and a later call to `Initiate` on the Preconnection
(see {{initiate}}) will internally resolve that name to a list of concrete
Endpoint Identifers. Specifying multiple Remote Endpoints on a Preconnection allows
applications to override this for more detailed control.

If Message Framers are used (see {{framing}}), they MUST be added to the
Preconnection during pre-establishment.

## Specifying Endpoints {#endpointspec}

The Transport Services API uses the Local Endpoint and Remote Endpoint objects
to refer to the endpoints of a Connection. Endpoints can be created
as either remote or local:

~~~
RemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()
LocalSpecifier := NewLocalEndpoint()
~~~

A single Endpoint object represents the identity of a network host. That endpoint
can be more or less specific depending on which Endpoint Identifiers are set. For example,
an Endpoint that only specifies a hostname can, in fact, finally correspond
to several different IP addresses on different hosts.

An Endpoint object can be configured with the following identifiers:

- HostName (string):

~~~
RemoteSpecifier.WithHostName("example.com")
~~~

- Port (a 16-bit unsigned Integer):

~~~
RemoteSpecifier.WithPort(443)
~~~

- Service (an identifier string that maps to a port; either the name of a well-known service, or a DNS SRV service name to be resolved):

~~~
RemoteSpecifier.WithService("https")
~~~

- IP address (IPv4 or IPv6 address):

~~~
RemoteSpecifier.WithIPAddress(192.0.2.21)
~~~

~~~
RemoteSpecifier.WithIPAddress(2001:db8:4920:e29d:a420:7461:7073:a)
~~~

- Interface name (string), e.g., to qualify link-local or multicast addresses (see {{ifspec}} for details):

~~~
LocalSpecifier.WithInterface("en0")
~~~

Note that an IPv6 address specified with a scope zone ID (e.g. `fe80::2001:db8%en0`)
is equivalent to `WithIPAddress` with an unscoped address and `WithInterface ` together.

Applications creating Endpoint objects using `WithHostName` SHOULD provide fully-qualified
domain names (FQDNs). Not providing an FQDN will result in the Transport Services Implementation
needing to resolve using DNS search domains, which might lead to inconsistent or unpredictable
behavior.

The design of the API MUST NOT permit an Endpoint object to be configured with multiple Endpoint Identifiers of the same type.
For example, an Endpoint object cannot specify two IP addresses. Two separate IP addresses
are represented as two Endpoint objects. If a Preconnection specifies a Remote
Endpoint with a specific IP address set, it will only establish Connections to
that IP address. If, on the other hand, a Remote Endpoint specifies a hostname
but no addresses, the Transport Services Implementation can perform name resolution and attempt
using any address derived from the original hostname of the Remote Endpoint.
Note that multiple Remote Endpoints can be added to a Preconnection, as discussed
in {{add-endpoints}}.

The Transport Services system resolves names internally, when the `Initiate`,
`Listen`, or `Rendezvous` method is called to establish a Connection. Privacy
considerations for the timing of this resolution are given in {{privacy-security}}.

The `Resolve` action on a Preconnection can be used by the application to force
early binding when required, for example with some Network Address Translator
(NAT) traversal protocols (see {{rendezvous}}).

### Using Multicast Endpoints

To use multicast, a Preconnection is first created with the Local/Remote Endpoint Identifer
specifying the any-source multicast (ASM) or source-specific multicast (SSM) multicast group and destination port number.
This is then followed by a call to either `Initiate`, `Listen`, or
`Rendezvous` depending on whether the resulting Connection is to be
used to send messages to the multicast group, receive messages from
the group, or, for an any-source multicast group, to both send and
receive messages.

Calling `Initiate` on that Preconnection creates a Connection that can be
used to send Messages to the multicast group. The Connection object that is
created will support `Send` but not `Receive`. Any Connections created this
way are send-only, and do not join the multicast group. The resulting
Connection will have a Local Endpoint identifying the local interface to
which the Connection is bound and a Remote Endpoint identifying the
multicast group.

The following API calls can be used to configure a Preconnection before calling `Initiate`:

~~~
RemoteSpecifier.WithMulticastGroupIP(GroupAddress)
RemoteSpecifier.WithPort(PortNumber)
RemoteSpecifier.WithHopLimit(HopLimit)
~~~

Calling `Listen` on a Preconnection with a multicast group specified on the Remote
Endpoint will join the multicast group to receive Messages. This Listener
will create one Connection for each Remote Endpoint sending to the group,
with the Local Endpoint Identifer specified as a group address. The set of Connection
objects created forms a Connection Group.
The receiving interface can be restricted by passing it as part of the LocalSpecifier or queried through the Message Context on the Messages received (see {{msg-ctx}} for further details).

Specifying WithHopLimit sets the Time To Live (TTL) field in the header of IPv4 packets or the Hop Count field in the header of IPv6 packets.

The following API calls can be used to configure a Preconnection before calling `Listen`:

~~~
LocalSpecifier.WithSingleSourceMulticastGroupIP(GroupAddress,
                                                SourceAddress)
LocalSpecifier.WithAnySourceMulticastGroupIP(GroupAddress)
LocalSpecifier.WithPort(PortNumber)
~~~

Calling `Rendezvous` on a Preconnection with an any-source multicast group
address as the Remote Endpoint Identifer will join the multicast group, and also
indicates that the resulting Connection can be used to send Messages to the
multicast group. The `Rendezvous` call will return both a Connection that
can be used to send to the group, that acts the same as a Connection
returned by calling `Initiate` with a multicast Remote Endpoint, and a
Listener that acts as if `Listen` had been called with a multicast Remote
Endpoint.
Calling `Rendezvous` on a Preconnection with a source-specific multicast
group address as the Local Endpoint Identifer results in an `EstablishmentError`.

The following API calls can be used to configure a Preconnection before calling `Rendezvous`:

~~~
RemoteSpecifier.WithMulticastGroupIP(GroupAddress)
RemoteSpecifier.WithPort(PortNumber)
RemoteSpecifier.WithHopLimit(HopLimit)
LocalSpecifier.WithAnySourceMulticastGroupIP(GroupAddress)
LocalSpecifier.WithPort(PortNumber)
LocalSpecifier.WithHopLimit(HopLimit)
~~~

See {{multicast-examples}} for more examples.

### Constraining Interfaces for Endpoints {#ifspec}

Note that this API has multiple ways to constrain and prioritize endpoint candidates based on the network interface:

 - Specifying an interface on a Remote Endpoint qualifies the scope zone of the Remote Endpoint, e.g., for link-local addresses.
 - Specifying an interface on a Local Endpoint explicitly binds all candidates derived from this Endpoint to use the specified interface.
 - Specifying an interface using the `interface` Selection Property ({{prop-interface}}) or indirectly via the `pvd` Selection Property ({{prop-pvd}}) influences the selection among the available candidates.

While specifying an Interface on an Endpoint restricts the candidates available for Connection establishment in the Pre-Establishment Phase, the Selection Properties prioritize and constrain the Connection establishment.

### Endpoint Aliases

An Endpoint can have an alternative definition when using different protocols.
For example, a server that supports both TLS/TCP and QUIC could be accessible
on two different port numbers depending on which protocol is used.

To support this, Endpoint objects can specify "aliases". An Endpoint can have
multiple aliases set.

~~~
RemoteSpecifier.AddAlias(AlternateRemoteSpecifier)
~~~

To scope an alias to apply conditionally to a specific transport
protocol (such as defining an alternate port to use when QUIC
is selected, as opposed to TCP), an alias Endpoint can be
associated with a protocol identifier. Protocol identifiers are
objects or enumeration values provided by the Transport
Services API, which will vary based on which protocols are
implemented in a particular system.

~~~
AlternateRemoteSpecifier.WithProtocol(QUIC)
~~~

The following example shows a case where `example.com` has a server
running on port 443, with an alternate port of 8443 for QUIC.

~~~
RemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()
RemoteSpecifier.WithHostName("example.com")
RemoteSpecifier.WithPort(443)

QUICRemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()
QUICRemoteSpecifier.WithHostName("example.com")
QUICRemoteSpecifier.WithPort(8443)
QUICRemoteSpecifier.WithProtocol(QUIC)

RemoteSpecifier.AddAlias(QUICRemoteSpecifier)
~~~

### Endpoint Examples

The following examples of Endpoints show common usage patterns.

Specify a Remote Endpoint using a hostname "example.com" and a service name "https", which tells the system to use the default port for HTTPS (443):

~~~
RemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()
RemoteSpecifier.WithHostName("example.com")
RemoteSpecifier.WithService("https")
~~~

Specify a Remote Endpoint using an IPv6 address and remote port:

~~~
RemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()
RemoteSpecifier.WithIPAddress(2001:db8:4920:e29d:a420:7461:7073:a)
RemoteSpecifier.WithPort(443)
~~~

Specify a Remote Endpoint using an IPv4 address and remote port:

~~~
RemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()
RemoteSpecifier.WithIPAddress(192.0.2.21)
RemoteSpecifier.WithPort(443)
~~~

Specify a Local Endpoint using a local interface name and local port:

~~~
LocalSpecifier := NewLocalEndpoint()
LocalSpecifier.WithInterface("en0")
LocalSpecifier.WithPort(443)
~~~

As an alternative to specifying an interface name for the Local Endpoint, an application
can express more fine-grained preferences using the `Interface Instance or Type`
Selection Property, see {{prop-interface}}. However, if the application specifies Selection
Properties that are inconsistent with the Local Endpoint, this will result in an error once the
application attempts to open a Connection.

Specify a Local Endpoint using a STUN server:

~~~
LocalSpecifier := NewLocalEndpoint()
LocalSpecifier.WithStunServer(address, port, credentials)
~~~

### Multicast Examples {#multicast-examples}

The following examples show how multicast groups can be used.

Join an Any-Source Multicast group in receive-only mode, bound to a known
port on a named local interface:

~~~
   RemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()

   LocalSpecifier := NewLocalEndpoint()
   LocalSpecifier.WithAnySourceMulticastGroupIP(233.252.0.0)
   LocalSpecifier.WithPort(5353)
   LocalSpecifier.WithInterface("en0")

   TransportProperties := ...
   SecurityParameters  := ...

   Preconnection := NewPreconnection(LocalSpecifier,
                                     RemoteSpecifier,
                                     TransportProperties,
                                     SecurityProperties)
   Listener := Preconnection.Listen()
~~~

Join a Source-Specific Multicast group in receive-only mode, bound to a known
port on a named local interface:

~~~
   RemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()

   LocalSpecifier := NewLocalEndpoint()

   LocalSpecifier.WithSingleSourceMulticastGroupIP(233.252.0.0,
                                                   198.51.100.10)
   LocalSpecifier.WithPort(5353)
   LocalSpecifier.WithInterface("en0")

   TransportProperties := ...
   SecurityParameters  := ...

   Preconnection := NewPreconnection(LocalSpecifier,
                                     RemoteSpecifier,
                                     TransportProperties,
                                     SecurityProperties)
   Listener := Preconnection.Listen()
~~~

Create a Source-Specific Multicast group as a sender:

~~~
   RemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()
   RemoteSpecifier.WithMulticastGroupIP(233.251.240.1)
   RemoteSpecifier.WithPort(5353)
   RemoteSpecifier.WithHopLimit(8)

   LocalSpecifier := NewLocalEndpoint()
   LocalSpecifier.WithIPAddress(192.0.2.22)
   LocalSpecifier.WithInterface("en0")

   TransportProperties := ...
   SecurityParameters  := ...

   Preconnection := NewPreconnection(LocalSpecifier,
                                     RemoteSpecifier,
                                     TransportProperties,
                                     SecurityProperties)
   Connection := Preconnection.Initiate()
~~~

Join an any-source multicast group as both a sender and a receiver:

~~~
   RemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()
   RemoteSpecifier.WithMulticastGroupIP(233.252.0.0)
   RemoteSpecifier.WithPort(5353)
   RemoteSpecifier.WithHopLimit(8)

   LocalSpecifier := NewLocalEndpoint()
   LocalSpecifier.WithAnySourceMulticastGroupIP(233.252.0.0)
   LocalSpecifier.WithIPAddress(192.0.2.22)
   LocalSpecifier.WithPort(5353)
   LocalSpecifier.WithInterface("en0")


   TransportProperties := ...
   SecurityParameters  := ...

   Preconnection := NewPreconnection(LocalSpecifier,
                                     RemoteSpecifier,
                                     TransportProperties,
                                     SecurityProperties)
   Connection, Listener := Preconnection.Rendezvous()
~~~

## Specifying Transport Properties {#selection-props}

A Preconnection object holds properties reflecting the application's
requirements and preferences for the transport. These include Selection
Properties for selecting Protocol Stacks and paths, as well as Connection
Properties and Message Properties for configuration of the detailed operation
of the selected Protocol Stacks on a per-Connection and Message level.

The protocol(s) and path(s) selected as candidates during establishment are
determined and configured using these properties. Since there could be paths
over which some transport protocols are unable to operate, or Remote Endpoints
that support only specific network addresses or transports, transport protocol
selection is necessarily tied to path selection. This could involve choosing
between multiple local interfaces that are connected to different access
networks.

When additional information (such as Provisioning Domain (PvD) information
{{?RFC7556}}) is available about the networks over which an endpoint can operate,
this can inform the selection between alternate network paths.
Path information can include PMTU, set of supported DSCPs,
expected usage, cost, etc. The usage of this information by the Transport
Services System is generally independent of the specific mechanism/protocol
used to receive the information (e.g. zero-conf, DHCP, or IPv6 RA).

Most Selection Properties are represented as Preferences, which can
take one of five values:

   | Preference | Effect                                                                 |
   |------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Require    | Select only protocols/paths providing the property, fail otherwise     |
   | Prefer     | Prefer protocols/paths providing the property, proceed otherwise       |
   | No Preference       | No preference                                                          |
   | Avoid      | Prefer protocols/paths not providing the property, proceed otherwise   |
   | Prohibit   | Select only protocols/paths not providing the property, fail otherwise |
{: #tab-pref-levels title="Selection Property Preference Levels"}

The implementation MUST ensure an outcome that is consistent with all application
requirements expressed using Require and Prohibit. While preferences
expressed using Prefer and Avoid influence protocol and path selection as well,
outcomes can vary given the same Selection Properties, because the available
protocols and paths can differ across systems and contexts. However,
implementations are RECOMMENDED to seek to provide a consistent outcome
to an application, when provided with the same set of Selection Properties.

Note that application preferences can conflict with each other. For
example, if an application indicates a preference for a specific path by
specifying an interface, but also a preference for a protocol, a situation
might occur in which the preferred protocol is not available on the preferred
path. In such cases, applications can expect properties that determine path
selection to be prioritized over properties that determine protocol selection.
The transport system SHOULD determine the preferred path first, regardless of
protocol preferences. This ordering is chosen to provide consistency across
implementations, based on the fact that it is more common for the use of a
given network path to determine cost to the user (i.e., an interface type
preference might be based on a user's preference to avoid being charged
more for a cellular data plan).

Selection and Connection Properties, as well as defaults for Message
Properties, can be added to a Preconnection to configure the selection process
and to further configure the eventually selected Protocol Stack(s). They are
collected into a TransportProperties object to be passed into a Preconnection
object:

~~~
TransportProperties := NewTransportProperties()
~~~

Individual properties are then set on the TransportProperties object.
Setting a Transport Property to a value overrides the previous value of this Transport Property.

~~~
TransportProperties.Set(property, value)
~~~

To aid readability, implementations MAY provide additional convenience functions to simplify use of Selection Properties: see {{preference-conv}} for examples.
In addition, implementations MAY provide a mechanism to create TransportProperties objects that
are preconfigured for common use cases, as outlined in {{property-profiles}}.

Transport Properties for an established Connection can be queried via the Connection object, as outlined in {{introspection}}.

A Connection gets its Transport Properties either by being explicitly configured
via a Preconnection, by configuration after establishment, or by inheriting them
from an antecedent via cloning; see {{groups}} for more.

{{connection-props}} provides a list of Connection Properties, while Selection
Properties are listed in the subsections below. Selection Properties are
only considered during establishment, and can not be changed after a Connection
is established. After a Connection is established, Selection Properties can only
be read to check the properties used by the Connection. Upon reading, the
Preference type of a Selection Property changes into Boolean, where `true` means
that the selected Protocol Stack supports the feature or uses the path associated
with the Selection Property, and `false` means that the Protocol Stack does not
support the feature or use the path. Implementations
of Transport Services systems could alternatively use the two Preference values `Require`
and `Prohibit` to represent `true` and `false`, respectively.
Other types of Selection Properties remain unchanged when they are made available for
reading after a Connection is established.

An implementation of the Transport Services API needs to provide sensible defaults for Selection
Properties. The default values for each property below represent a
configuration that can be implemented over TCP. If these default values are used
and TCP is not supported by a Transport Services system, then an application using the
default set of Properties might not succeed in establishing a Connection. Using
the same default values for independent Transport Services systems can be beneficial
when applications are ported between different implementations/platforms, even if this
default could lead to a Connection failure when TCP is not available. If default
values other than those suggested below are used, it is RECOMMENDED to clearly
document any differences.


### Reliable Data Transfer (Connection) {#prop-reliable}

Name:
: reliability

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: Require

This property specifies whether the application needs to use a transport
protocol that ensures that
all data is received at the Remote Endpoint in order without loss or duplication.
When reliable data transfer is enabled, this
also entails being notified when a Connection is closed or aborted.

### Preservation of Message Boundaries {#prop-boundaries}

Name:
: preserveMsgBoundaries

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: No Preference

This property specifies whether the application needs or prefers to use a transport
protocol that preserves message boundaries.

### Configure Per-Message Reliability {#prop-partially-reliable}

Name:
: perMsgReliability

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: No Preference

This property specifies whether an application considers it useful to specify different
reliability requirements for individual Messages in a Connection.

### Preservation of Data Ordering {#prop-ordering}

Name:
: preserveOrder

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: Require

This property specifies whether the application wishes to use a transport
protocol that can ensure that data is received by the application at the Remote Endpoint in the same order as it was sent.

### Use 0-RTT Session Establishment with a Safely Replayable Message {#prop-0rtt}

Name:
: zeroRttMsg

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: No Preference

This property specifies whether an application would like to supply a Message to
the transport protocol before connection establishment that will then be
reliably transferred to the Remote Endpoint before or during connection
establishment. This Message can potentially be received multiple times (i.e.,
multiple copies of the Message data could be passed to the Remote Endpoint).
See also {{msg-safelyreplayable}}.

### Multistream Connections in Group {#prop-multistream}

Name:
: multistreaming

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: Prefer

This property specifies whether the application would prefer multiple Connections
within a Connection Group to be provided by streams of a single underlying
transport connection where possible.

### Full Checksum Coverage on Sending {#prop-checksum-control-send}

Name:
: fullChecksumSend

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: Require

This property specifies the application's need for protection against
corruption for all data transmitted on this Connection. Disabling this property could enable
the application to influence the sender checksum coverage after Connection establishment (see {{msg-checksum}}).

### Full Checksum Coverage on Receiving {#prop-checksum-control-receive}

Name:
: fullChecksumRecv

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: Require

This property specifies the application's need for protection against
corruption for all data received on this Connection. Disabling this property could enable
the application to influence the required minimum receiver checksum coverage after Connection establishment (see {{conn-recv-checksum}}).

### Congestion control {#prop-cc}

Name:
: congestionControl

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: Require

This property specifies whether the application would like the Connection to be
congestion controlled or not. Note that if a Connection is not congestion
controlled, an application using such a Connection SHOULD itself perform
congestion control in accordance with {{?RFC2914}} or use a circuit breaker in
accordance with {{?RFC8084}}, whichever is appropriate. Also note that reliability
is usually combined with congestion control in protocol implementations,
rendering "reliable but not congestion controlled" a request that is unlikely to
succeed. If the Connection is congestion controlled, performing additional congestion control
in the application can have negative performance implications.

### Keep alive {#keep-alive}

Name:
: keepAlive

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: No Preference

This property specifies whether the application would like the Connection to send
keep-alive packets or not. Note that if a Connection determines that keep-alive
packets are being sent, the application SHOULD itself avoid generating additional keep-alive
messages. Note that when supported, the system will use the default period
for generation of the keep alive-packets. (See also {{keep-alive-timeout}}).

### Interface Instance or Type {#prop-interface}

Name:
: interface

Type:
: Set of (Preference, Enumeration)

Default:
: Empty (not setting a preference for any interface)

This property allows the application to select any specific network interfaces
or categories of interfaces it wants to `Require`, `Prohibit`, `Prefer`, or
`Avoid`. Note that marking a specific interface as `Require` strictly limits path
selection to that single interface, and often leads to less flexible and resilient
connection establishment.

In contrast to other Selection Properties, this property is a set of
tuples of (Enumerated) interface identifier and preference. It can either be
implemented directly as such, or for making one preference available for each
interface and interface type available on the system.

The set of valid interface types is implementation- and system-specific. For
example, on a mobile device, there could be `Wi-Fi` and `Cellular` interface types
available; whereas on a desktop computer, `Wi-Fi` and `Wired
Ethernet` interface types might be available. An implementation should provide all types
that are supported on the local system, to allow
applications to be written generically. For example, if a single implementation
is used on both mobile devices and desktop devices, it ought to define the
`Cellular` interface type for both systems, since an application might wish to
always prohibit cellular.

The set of interface types is expected to change over time as new access
technologies become available. The taxonomy of interface types on a given
Transport Services system is implementation-specific.

Interface types SHOULD NOT be treated as a proxy for properties of interfaces
such as metered or unmetered network access. If an application needs to prohibit
metered interfaces, this should be specified via Provisioning Domain attributes
(see {{prop-pvd}}) or another specific property.

Note that this property is not used to specify an interface scope zone for a particular Endpoint. {{ifspec}} provides details about how to qualify endpoint candidates on a per-interface basis.

### Provisioning Domain Instance or Type {#prop-pvd}

Name:
: pvd

Type:
: Set of (Preference, Enumeration)

Default:
: Empty (not setting a preference for any PvD)

Similar to `interface` (see {{prop-interface}}), this property
allows the application to control path selection by selecting which specific
Provisioning Domain (PvD) or categories of PVDs it wants to
`Require`, `Prohibit`, `Prefer`, or `Avoid`. Provisioning Domains define
consistent sets of network properties that might be more specific than network
interfaces {{?RFC7556}}.

As with interface instances and types, this property is a set of tuples of (Enumerated)
PvD identifier and preference. It can either be implemented directly as such,
or for making one preference available for each interface and interface type
available on the system.

The identification of a specific PvD is implementation- and system-specific.
{{?RFC8801}} defines how to use an FQDN to identify a PvD when advertised by
a network, but systems might also use other locally-relevant identifiers
such as string names or Integers to identify PvDs. As with requiring specific
interfaces, requiring a specific PvD strictly limits the path selection.

Categories or types of PvDs are also defined to be implementation- and
system-specific. These can be useful to identify a service that is provided by a
PvD. For example, if an application wants to use a PvD that provides a
Voice-Over-IP service on a Cellular network, it can use the relevant PvD type to
require a PvD that provides this service, without needing to look up a
particular instance. While this does restrict path selection, it is broader than
requiring specific PvD instances or interface instances, and should be preferred
over these options.

### Use Temporary Local Address

Name:
: useTemporaryLocalAddress

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: Avoid for Listeners and Rendezvous Connections. Prefer for other Connections.

This property allows the application to express a preference for the use of
temporary local addresses, sometimes called "privacy" addresses {{?RFC8981}}.
Temporary addresses are generally used to prevent linking connections over time
when a stable address, sometimes called "permanent" address, is not needed.
There are some caveats to note when specifying this property. First, if an
application Requires the use of temporary addresses, the resulting Connection
cannot use IPv4, because temporary addresses do not exist in IPv4. Second,
temporary local addresses might involve trading off privacy for performance.
For instance, temporary addresses (e.g., {{?RFC8981}}) can interfere with resumption mechanisms
that some protocols rely on to reduce initial latency.

### Multipath Transport {#multipath-mode}

Name:
: multipath

Type:
: Enumeration

Default:
: Disabled for Connections created through initiate and rendezvous, Passive for Listeners

This property specifies whether and how applications want to take advantage of
transferring data across multiple paths between the same end hosts.
Using multiple paths allows Connections to migrate between interfaces or aggregate bandwidth
as availability and performance properties change.
Possible values are:

Disabled:
: The Connection will not use multiple paths once established, even if the chosen transport supports using multiple paths.

Active:
: The Connection will negotiate the use of multiple paths if the chosen transport supports this.

Passive:
: The Connection will support the use of multiple paths if the Remote Endpoint requests it.

The policy for using multiple paths is specified using the separate `multipathPolicy` property, see {{multipath-policy}} below.
To enable the peer endpoint to initiate additional paths towards a local address other than the one initially used, it is necessary to set the `advertisesAltaddr` property (see {{altaddr}} below).

Setting this property to `Active` can have privacy implications: It enables the transport to establish connectivity using alternate paths that might result in users being linkable across the multiple paths, even if the `advertisesAltaddr` property (see {{altaddr}} below) is set to `false`.

Note that Multipath Transport has no corresponding Selection Property of type Preference.
Enumeration values other than `Disabled` are interpreted as a preference for choosing protocols that can make use of multiple paths.
The `Disabled` value implies a requirement not to use multiple paths in parallel but does not prevent choosing a protocol that is capable of using multiple paths, e.g., it does not prevent choosing TCP, but prevents sending the `MP_CAPABLE` option in the TCP handshake.

### Advertisement of Alternative Addresses {#altaddr}

Name:
: advertisesAltaddr

Type:
: Boolean

Default:
: `false`

This property specifies whether alternative addresses, e.g., of other interfaces, ought to be advertised to the
peer endpoint by the Protocol Stack. Advertising these addresses enables the peer endpoint to establish additional connectivity, e.g., for Connection migration or using multiple paths.

Note that this can have privacy implications because it might result in users being linkable across the multiple paths.
Also, note that setting this to `false` does not prevent the local Transport Services system from _establishing_ connectivity using alternate paths (see {{multipath-mode}} above); it only prevents _proactive advertisement_ of addresses.

### Direction of communication

Name:
: direction

Type:
: Enumeration

Default:
: Bidirectional

This property specifies whether an application wants to use the Connection for sending and/or receiving data.  Possible values are:

Bidirectional:
: The Connection must support sending and receiving data

Unidirectional send:
: The Connection must support sending data, and the application cannot use the Connection to receive any data

Unidirectional receive:
: The Connection must support receiving data, and the application cannot use the Connection to send any data

Since unidirectional communication can be
supported by transports offering bidirectional communication, specifying
unidirectional communication might cause a transport stack that supports
bidirectional communication to be selected.


### Notification of ICMP soft error message arrival {#prop-soft-error}

Name:
: softErrorNotify

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: No Preference

This property specifies whether an application considers it useful to be
informed when an ICMP error message arrives that does not force termination of a
connection. When set to `true`, received ICMP errors are available as
`SoftError` events, see {{soft-errors}}. Note that even if a protocol supporting this property is selected,
not all ICMP errors will necessarily be delivered, so applications cannot rely
upon receiving them {{?RFC8085}}.


### Initiating side is not the first to write {#active-read-before-send}

Name:
: activeReadBeforeSend

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: No Preference

The most common client-server communication pattern involves the
client actively opening a Connection, then sending data to the server. The
server listens (passive open), reads, and then answers. This property
specifies whether an application wants to diverge from this pattern -- either
by actively opening with `Initiate`, immediately followed by reading, or passively opening with `Listen`,
immediately followed by writing. This property is ignored when establishing
connections using `Rendezvous`.
Requiring this property limits the choice of mappings to underlying protocols,
which can reduce
efficiency. For example, it prevents the Transport Services system from mapping
Connections to SCTP streams, where
the first transmitted data takes the role of anÂ active open signal.


## Specifying Security Parameters and Callbacks {#security-parameters}

Most security parameters, e.g., TLS ciphersuites, local identity and private key, etc.,
can be configured statically. Others are dynamically configured during Connection establishment.
Security parameters and callbacks are partitioned based on their place in the lifetime
of Connection establishment. Similar to Transport Properties, both parameters and callbacks
are inherited during cloning (see {{groups}}).

### Specifying Security Parameters on a Pre-Connection

Common security parameters such as TLS ciphersuites are known to implementations. Clients should
use common safe defaults for these values whenever possible. However, as discussed in
{{?RFC8922}}, many transport security protocols require specific
security parameters and constraints from the client at the time of configuration and
actively during a handshake. These configuration parameters need to be specified in the
pre-connection phase and are created as follows:

~~~
SecurityParameters := NewSecurityParameters()
~~~

Security configuration parameters and sample usage follow:

- Application-layer protocol negotiation (ALPN) values: used to indicate which application-layer protocols
are negotiated by the security protocol layer. See {{!ALPN=RFC7301}} for definition of the ALPN field. Note that the Transport Services System can provide ALPN values automatically, based on
the protocols being used, if not explicitly specified by the application.

~~~
SecurityParameters.Set(alpn, "h2")
~~~

- Local identity, certificates, and private keys: Used to perform private key operations and prove one's
identity to the Remote Endpoint. (Note, if private keys are not available, e.g., since they are
stored in hardware security modules (HSMs), handshake callbacks must be used. See below for details.)

~~~
SecurityParameters.Set(identity, myIdentity)
SecurityParameters.Set(server-certificate, myCertificate)
SecurityParameters.Set(client-certificate, myCertificate)
SecurityParameters.Set(key-pair, myPrivateKey, myPublicKey)
~~~

- Supported algorithms: Used to restrict what parameters are used by underlying transport security protocols.
When not specified, these algorithms should use known and safe defaults for the system. Parameters include:
ciphersuites, supported groups, and signature algorithms. These parameters take a collection of supported algorithms as parameter.

~~~
SecurityParameters.Set(supported-group, "secp256r1")
SecurityParameters.Set(ciphersuite, "TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256")
SecurityParameters.Set(signature-algorithm, "ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256")
~~~

- Pre-Shared Key import: Used to install pre-shared keying material established
out-of-band. Each pre-shared keying material is associated with some identity that typically identifies
its use or has some protocol-specific meaning to the Remote Endpoint.

~~~
SecurityParameters.Set(pre-shared-key, key, myIdentity)
~~~

- Session cache management: Used to tune session cache capacity, lifetime, and
other policies.

~~~
SecurityParameters.Set(max-cached-sessions, 16)
SecurityParameters.Set(cached-session-lifetime-seconds, 3600)
~~~

Connections that use Transport Services SHOULD use security in general. However, for
compatibility with endpoints that do not support transport security protocols (such
as a TCP endpoint that does not support TLS), applications can initialize their
security parameters to indicate that security can be disabled, or can be opportunistic.
If security is disabled, the Transport Services system will not attempt to add
transport security automatically. If security is opportunistic, it will allow
Connections without transport security, but will still attempt to use unauthenticated
security if available.

~~~
SecurityParameters := NewDisabledSecurityParameters()

SecurityParameters := NewOpportunisticSecurityParameters()
~~~

Representation of security parameters in implementations ought to parallel
that chosen for Transport Property names as suggested in {{scope-of-interface-defn}}.

### Connection Establishment Callbacks

Security decisions, especially pertaining to trust, are not static. Once configured,
parameters can also be supplied during Connection establishment. These are best
handled as client-provided callbacks.
Callbacks block the progress of the Connection establishment, which distinguishes them from other events in the transport system. How callbacks and events are implemented is specific to each implementation.
Security handshake callbacks that could be invoked during Connection establishment include:

- Trust verification callback: Invoked when a Remote Endpoint's trust must be verified before the
handshake protocol can continue. For example, the application could verify an X.509 certificate
as described in {{?RFC5280}}.

~~~
TrustCallback := NewCallback({
  // Handle trust, return the result
})
SecurityParameters.SetTrustVerificationCallback(TrustCallback)
~~~

- Identity challenge callback: Invoked when a private key operation is required, e.g., when
local authentication is requested by a Remote Endpoint.

~~~
ChallengeCallback := NewCallback({
  // Handle challenge
})
SecurityParameters.SetIdentityChallengeCallback(ChallengeCallback)
~~~

# Establishing Connections {#establishment}

Before a Connection can be used for data transfer, it needs to be established.
Establishment ends the pre-establishment phase; all transport properties and
cryptographic parameter specification must be complete before establishment,
as these will be used to select candidate Paths and Protocol Stacks
for the Connection. Establishment can be active, using the `Initiate` action;
passive, using the `Listen` action; or simultaneous for peer-to-peer, using
the `Rendezvous` action. These actions are described in the subsections below.


## Active Open: Initiate {#initiate}

Active open is the action of establishing a Connection to a Remote Endpoint presumed
to be listening for incoming Connection requests. Active open is used by clients in
client-server interactions. Active open is supported by the Transport Services API through the
`Initiate` action:

~~~
Connection := Preconnection.Initiate(timeout?)
~~~

The timeout parameter specifies how long to wait before aborting Active open.
Before calling `Initiate`, the caller must have populated a Preconnection
object with a Remote Endpoint object to identify the endpoint, optionally a Local Endpoint
object (if not specified, the system will attempt to determine a
suitable Local Endpoint), as well as all properties
necessary for candidate selection.

The `Initiate` action returns a Connection object. Once `Initiate` has been
called, any changes to the Preconnection MUST NOT have any effect on the
Connection. However, the Preconnection can be reused, e.g., to `Initiate`
another Connection.

Once `Initiate` is called, the candidate Protocol Stack(s) can cause one or more
candidate transport-layer connections to be created to the specified Remote
Endpoint. The caller could immediately begin sending Messages on the Connection
(see {{sending}}) after calling `Initiate`; note that any data marked as "safely replayable" that is sent
while the Connection is being established could be sent multiple times or on
multiple candidates.

The following events can be sent by the Connection after `Initiate` is called:

~~~
Connection -> Ready<>
~~~

The `Ready` event occurs after `Initiate` has established a transport-layer
connection on at least one usable candidate Protocol Stack over at least one
candidate Path. No `Receive` events (see {{receiving}}) will occur before
the `Ready` event for Connections established using `Initiate`.

~~~
Connection -> EstablishmentError<reason?>
~~~

An `EstablishmentError` occurs either when the set of transport properties and security
parameters cannot be fulfilled on a Connection for initiation (e.g., the set of
available Paths and/or Protocol Stacks meeting the constraints is empty) or
reconciled with the Local and/or Remote Endpoints; when a remote Endpoint Identifier
cannot be resolved; or when no transport-layer connection can be established to
the Remote Endpoint (e.g., because the Remote Endpoint is not accepting
connections, the application is prohibited from opening a Connection by the
operating system, or the establishment attempt has timed out for any other reason).

Connection establishment
and transmission of the first Message can be combined in a single action ({{initiate-and-send}}).

## Passive Open: Listen {#listen}

Passive open is the action of waiting for Connections from Remote Endpoints,
commonly used by servers in client-server interactions. Passive open is
supported by the Transport Services API through the `Listen` action and returns a Listener object:

~~~
Listener := Preconnection.Listen()
~~~

Before calling `Listen`, the caller must have initialized the Preconnection
during the pre-establishment phase with a Local Endpoint object, as well
as all properties necessary for Protocol Stack selection. A Remote Endpoint
can optionally be specified, to constrain what Connections are accepted.

The `Listen` action returns a Listener object. Once `Listen` has been called,
any changes to the Preconnection MUST NOT have any effect on the Listener. The
Preconnection can be disposed of or reused, e.g., to create another Listener.

~~~
Listener.Stop()
~~~

Listening continues until the global context shuts down, or until the Stop
action is performed on the Listener object.

~~~
Listener -> ConnectionReceived<Connection>
~~~

The `ConnectionReceived` event occurs when a Remote Endpoint has established or cloned (e.g., by creating a new stream in a multi-stream transport; see {{groups}}) a
transport-layer connection to this Listener (for Connection-oriented
transport protocols), or when the first Message has been received from the
Remote Endpoint (for Connectionless protocols or streams of a multi-streaming transport), causing a new Connection to be
created. The resulting Connection is contained within the `ConnectionReceived`
event, and is ready to use as soon as it is passed to the application via the
event.

~~~
Listener.SetNewConnectionLimit(value)
~~~

If the caller wants to rate-limit the number of inbound Connections that will be delivered,
it can set a cap using `SetNewConnectionLimit`. This mechanism allows a server to
protect itself from being drained of resources. Each time a new Connection is delivered
by the `ConnectionReceived` event, the value is automatically decremented. Once the
value reaches zero, no further Connections will be delivered until the caller sets the
limit to a higher value. By default, this value is Infinite. The caller is also able to reset
the value to Infinite at any point.

~~~
Listener -> EstablishmentError<reason?>
~~~

An `EstablishmentError` occurs either when the Properties and security parameters of the Preconnection cannot be fulfilled for listening or cannot be reconciled with the Local Endpoint (and/or Remote Endpoint, if specified), when the Local Endpoint (or Remote Endpoint, if specified) cannot
be resolved, or when the application is prohibited from listening by policy.

~~~
Listener -> Stopped<>
~~~

A `Stopped` event occurs after the Listener has stopped listening.

## Peer-to-Peer Establishment: Rendezvous {#rendezvous}

Simultaneous peer-to-peer Connection establishment is supported by the
`Rendezvous` action:

~~~
Preconnection.Rendezvous()
~~~

A Preconnection object used in a `Rendezvous` MUST have both the
Local Endpoint candidates and the Remote Endpoint candidates specified,
along with the Transport Properties and security parameters needed for
Protocol Stack selection, before the `Rendezvous` action is initiated.

The `Rendezvous` action listens on the Local Endpoint
candidates for an incoming Connection from the Remote Endpoint candidates,
while also simultaneously trying to establish a Connection from the Local
Endpoint candidates to the Remote Endpoint candidates.

If there are multiple Local Endpoints or Remote Endpoints configured, then
initiating a `Rendezvous` action will systematically probe the reachability
of those endpoint candidates following an approach such as that used in
Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) {{?RFC8445}}.

If the endpoints are suspected to be behind a NAT, `Rendezvous` can be
initiated using Local Endpoints that support a method of discovering NAT
bindings such as Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) {{?RFC8489}} or
Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) {{?RFC8656}}.  In this case, the
Local Endpoint will resolve to a mixture of local and server reflexive
addresses. The `Resolve` action on the Preconnection can be used to
discover these bindings:

~~~
[]LocalEndpoint, []RemoteEndpoint := Preconnection.Resolve()
~~~

The `Resolve` call returns lists of Local Endpoints and Remote Endpoints,
that represent the concrete addresses, local and server reflexive, on which
a `Rendezvous` for the Preconnection will listen for incoming Connections,
and to which it will attempt to establish Connections.

Note that the set of Local Endpoints returned by `Resolve` might or might not
contain information about all possible local interfaces; it is valid only
for a Rendezvous happening at the same time as the resolution. Care ought to
be taken in using these values in any other context.

An application that uses `Rendezvous` to establish a peer-to-peer Connection
in the presence of NATs will configure the Preconnection object with at least
one Local Endpoint that supports NAT binding discovery. It will then `Resolve`
the Preconnection, and pass the resulting list of Local Endpoint candidates to
the peer via a signalling protocol, for example as part of an ICE {{?RFC8445}}
exchange within SIP {{?RFC3261}} or WebRTC {{?RFC7478}}.  The peer will then,
via the same signalling channel, return the Remote Endpoint candidates.
The set of Remote Endpoint candidates are then configured onto the Preconnection:

~~~
Preconnection.AddRemote([]RemoteEndpoint)
~~~

The `Rendezvous` action can be initiated once both the Local Endpoint
candidates and the Remote Endpoint candidates retrieved from the peer via
the signalling channel have been added to the Preconnection.


If successful, the `Rendezvous` action returns a Connection object via a
`RendezvousDone<>` event:

~~~
Preconnection -> RendezvousDone<Connection>
~~~

The `RendezvousDone<>` event occurs when a Connection is established with the
Remote Endpoint. For Connection-oriented transports, this occurs when the
transport-layer connection is established; for Connectionless transports,
it occurs when the first Message is received from the Remote Endpoint. The
resulting Connection is contained within the `RendezvousDone<>` event, and is
ready to use as soon as it is passed to the application via the event.
Changes made to a Preconnection after `Rendezvous` has been called MUST
NOT have any effect on existing Connections.

An `EstablishmentError` occurs either when the Properties and Security
Parameters of the Preconnection cannot be fulfilled for rendezvous or
cannot be reconciled with the Local and/or Remote Endpoints, when the Local
Endpoint or Remote Endpoint cannot be resolved, when no transport-layer
connection can be established to the Remote Endpoint, or when the
application is prohibited from rendezvous by policy:

~~~
Preconnection -> EstablishmentError<reason?>
~~~



## Connection Groups {#groups}

Connection Groups can be created using the `Clone` action:

~~~
Connection := Connection.Clone(framer?, connectionProperties?)
~~~

Calling `Clone` on a Connection yields a Connection Group containing two Connections: the parent
Connection on which `Clone` was called, and a resulting cloned Connection.
The new Connection is actively opened, and it will locally send a `Ready` event or an `EstablishmentError` event.
Calling `Clone` on any of these Connections adds another Connection to
the Connection Group. Connections in a Connection Group share all
Connection Properties except `connPriority` (see {{conn-priority}}),
and these Connection Properties are entangled: Changing one of the
Connection Properties on one Connection in the Connection Group
automatically changes the Connection Property for all others. For example, changing
`connTimeout` (see
{{conn-timeout}}) on one Connection in a Connection Group will automatically
make the same change to this Connection Property for all other Connections in the Connection Group.
Like all other Properties, `connPriority` is copied
to the new Connection when calling `Clone`, but in this case, a later change to the
`connPriority` on one Connection does not change it on the
other Connections in the same Connection Group.

The optional `connectionProperties` parameter allows passing
Transport Properties that control the behavior of the underlying stream or connection to be created, e.g., Protocol-specific Properties to request specific stream IDs for SCTP or QUIC.

Message Properties set on a Connection also apply only to that Connection.

A new Connection created by `Clone` can have a Message Framer assigned via the optional
`framer` parameter of the `Clone` action. If this parameter is not supplied, the
stack of Message Framers associated with a Connection is copied to
the cloned Connection when calling `Clone`. Then, a cloned Connection
has the same stack of Message Framers as the Connection from which they
are cloned, but these Framers can internally maintain per-Connection state.

It is also possible to check which Connections belong to the same Connection Group.
Calling `GroupedConnections` on a specific Connection returns a set of all Connections
in the same group.

~~~
[]Connection := Connection.GroupedConnections()
~~~

Connections will belong to the same group if the application previously called `Clone`.
Passive Connections can also be added to the same group -- e.g., when a Listener
receives a new Connection that is just a new stream of an already active multi-streaming
protocol instance.

If the underlying protocol supports multi-streaming, it is natural to use this
functionality to implement `Clone`. In that case, Connections in a Connection Group are
multiplexed together, giving them similar treatment not only inside Endpoints,
but also across the end-to-end Internet path.

Note that calling `Clone` can result in on-the-wire signaling, e.g., to open a new
transport connection, depending on the underlying Protocol Stack. When `Clone` leads to
the opening of multiple such connections,
the Transport Services system will ensure consistency of
Connection Properties by uniformly applying them to all underlying connections
in a group. Even in such a case, there are possibilities for a Transport Services system
to implement prioritization within a Connection Group {{TCP-COUPLING}} {{?RFC8699}}.

Attempts to clone a Connection can result in a `CloneError`:

~~~
Connection -> CloneError<reason?>
~~~

The `connPriority` Connection Property operates on Connections in a Connection Group
using the same approach as in {{msg-priority}}: when allocating available network
capacity among Connections in a Connection Group, sends on Connections with
numerically lower Priority values will be prioritized over sends on Connections that have
numerically higher Priority values. Capacity will be shared among these Connections according to
the `connScheduler` property ({{conn-scheduler}}).
See {{priority-in-taps}} for more.


## Adding and Removing Endpoints on a Connection {#add-endpoints}

Transport protocols that are explicitly multipath aware are expected to automatically
manage the set of Remote Endpoints that they are communicating with, and the paths to
those endpoints. A `PathChange<>` event, described in {{conn-path-change}}, will be
generated when the path changes.

In some cases, however, it is necessary to explicitly indicate to a Connection that
a new Remote Endpoint has become available for use, or to indicate that a Remote
Endpoint is no longer available. This is most common in the case of peer to peer
connections using Trickle ICE {{?RFC8838}}.

The `AddRemote` action can be used to add one or more new Remote Endpoints
to a Connection:

~~~
Connection.AddRemote([]RemoteEndpoint)
~~~

Endpoints that are already known to the Connection are ignored. A call to
`AddRemote` makes the new Remote Endpoints available to the Connection,
but whether the Connection makes use of those Endpoints will depend on the
underlying transport protocol.

Similarly, the `RemoveRemote` action can be used to tell a Connection to
stop using one or more Remote Endpoints:

~~~
Connection.RemoveRemote([]RemoteEndpoint)
~~~

Removing all known Remote Endpoints can have the effect of aborting the
connection. The effect of removing the active Remote Endpoint(s) depends
on the underlying transport: multipath aware transports might be able to
switch to a new path if other reachable Remote Endpoints exist, or the
connection might abort.

Similarly, the `AddLocal` and `RemoveLocal` actions can be used to add
and remove Local Endpoints to/from a Connection.


# Managing Connections {#introspection}

During pre-establishment and after establishment, (Pre-)Connections can be configured and queried using Connection
Properties, and asynchronous information could be available about the state of the
Connection via `SoftError` events.

Connection Properties represent the configuration and state of the selected
Protocol Stack(s) backing a Connection. These Connection Properties can be
generic, applying regardless of transport protocol, or specific, applicable to a
single implementation of a single transport Protocol Stack. Generic Connection
Properties are defined in {{connection-props}} below.

Protocol-specific Properties are defined in a transport- and
implementation-specific way to
permit more specialized protocol features to be used.
Too much reliance by an application on Protocol-specific Properties can significantly reduce the flexibility
of a transport services system to make appropriate
selection and configuration choices. Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that
Generic Connection Properties are used for properties common across different protocols and that
Protocol-specific Connection Properties are only used where specific protocols or properties are necessary.

The application can set and query Connection Properties on a per-Connection
basis. Connection Properties that are not read-only can be set during
pre-establishment (see {{selection-props}}), as well as on Connections directly using
the `SetProperty` action:

~~~
ErrorCode := Connection.SetProperty(property, value)
~~~

If an error is encountered in setting a property (for example, if the application tries to set a TCP-specific property on a Connection that is not using TCP), the application MUST be informed about this error via the `ErrorCode` Object. Such errors MUST NOT cause the Connection to be terminated.
Note that changing one of the Connection Properties on one Connection in a Connection Group
will also change it for all other Connections of that group; see further {{groups}}.

At any point, the application can query Connection Properties.

~~~
ConnectionProperties := Connection.GetProperties()
value := ConnectionProperties.Get(property)
if ConnectionProperties.Has(boolean_or_preference_property) then ...
~~~

Depending on the status of the Connection, the queried Connection
Properties will include different information:

* The Connection state, which can be one of the following:
  Establishing, Established, Closing, or Closed.

* Whether the Connection can be used to send data. A Connection can not be used
  for sending if the Connection was created with the Selection Property
  `direction` set to `unidirectional receive` or if a Message
  marked as `Final` was sent over this Connection. See also {{msg-final}}.

* Whether the Connection can be used to receive data. A Connection cannot be
  used for reading if the Connection was created with the Selection Property
  `direction` set to `unidirectional send` or if a Message
  marked as `Final` was received. See {{receiving-final-messages}}. The latter
  is only supported by certain transport protocols, e.g., by TCP as half-closed
  connection.

* For Connections that are Established, Closing, or Closed:
  Connection Properties ({{connection-props}}) of the
  actual protocols that were selected and instantiated, and Selection
  Properties that the application specified on the Preconnection.
  Selection Properties of type `Preference` will be exposed as boolean values
  indicating whether or not the property applies to the selected transport.
  Note that the instantiated Protocol Stack might not match all
  Protocol Selection Properties that the application specified on the
  Preconnection.

* For Connections that are Established: information concerning the
  path(s) used by the Protocol Stack. This can be derived from local PVD information,
  measurements by the Protocol Stack, or other sources.
  For example, a Transport System that is configured to receive and process PVD information
  {{?RFC7556}} could also provide network configuration information for the chosen path(s).

## Generic Connection Properties {#connection-props}

Generic Connection Properties are defined independent of the chosen Protocol Stack
and therefore available on all Connections.

Many Connection Properties have a corresponding Selection Property that
enables applications to express their preference for protocols providing a supporting transport feature.


### Required Minimum Corruption Protection Coverage for Receiving {#conn-recv-checksum}

Name:
: recvChecksumLen

Type:
: Integer (non-negative) or `Full Coverage`

Default:
: `Full Coverage`

If this property is an Integer, it specifies the minimum number of bytes in a received
Message that need to be covered by a checksum.
A receiving endpoint will not forward Messages that have less coverage
to the application. The application is responsible for handling
any corruption within the non-protected part of the Message {{?RFC8085}}.
A special value of 0 means that a received packet might also have a zero checksum field,
and the enumerated value `Full Coverage` means
that the entire Message needs to be protected by a checksum. An implementation
is supposed to express `Full Coverage` in an environment-typical way, e.g., as a Union type or special value.

### Connection Priority {#conn-priority}

Name:
: connPriority

Type:
: Integer (non-negative)

Default:
: 100

This property is a non-negative Integer representing the
priority of this Connection
relative to other Connections in the same
Connection Group. A numerically lower value reflects a higher priority. It has no effect
on Connections not part of a Connection
Group. As noted in {{groups}}, this property is not entangled when Connections
are cloned, i.e., changing the Priority on one Connection in a Connection Group
does not change it on the other Connections in the same Connection Group.
No guarantees of a specific behavior regarding Connection Priority are given;
a Transport Services system could ignore this property. See {{priority-in-taps}} for more details.

### Timeout for Aborting Connection {#conn-timeout}

Name:
: connTimeout

Type:
: Numeric (non-negative) or `Disabled`

Default:
: `Disabled`

If this property is Numeric, it specifies how long to wait before deciding that an active Connection has
failed when trying to reliably deliver data to the Remote Endpoint. Adjusting this property
will only take effect when the underlying stack supports reliability. If this property has the enumerated
value `Disabled`, it means that no timeout is scheduled. A Transport Services API
could express `Disabled` in an environment-typical way, e.g., as a Union type or special value.

### Timeout for keep alive packets {#keep-alive-timeout}

Name:
: keepAliveTimeout

Type:
: Numeric (non-negative) or `Disabled`

Default:
: `Disabled`

A Transport Services API can request a protocol that supports sending keep alive packets ({{keep-alive}}).
If this property is Numeric, it specifies the maximum length of time an idle Connection (one for which no transport
packets have been sent) ought to wait before
the Local Endpoint sends a keep-alive packet to the Remote Endpoint. Adjusting this property
will only take effect when the underlying stack supports sending keep-alive packets.
Guidance on setting this value for connection-less transports is
provided in {{?RFC8085}}.
A value greater than the Connection timeout ({{conn-timeout}}) or the enumerated value `Disabled` will disable the sending of keep-alive packets. A Transport Services API
could express `Disabled` in an environment-typical way, e.g., as a Union type or special value.

### Connection Group Transmission Scheduler {#conn-scheduler}

Name:
: connScheduler

Type:
: Enumeration

Default:
: Weighted Fair Queueing (see Section 3.6 in {{?RFC8260}})

This property specifies which scheduler is used among Connections within
a Connection Group to apportion the available capacity according to Connection priorities
(see {{groups}} and {{conn-priority}}). A set of schedulers is
described in {{?RFC8260}}.

### Capacity Profile {#prop-cap-profile}

Name:
: connCapacityProfile

Type:
: Enumeration

Default:
: Default Profile (Best Effort)

This property specifies the desired network treatment for traffic sent by the
application and the tradeoffs the application is prepared to make in path and
protocol selection to receive that desired treatment. When the capacity profile
is set to a value other than Default, the Transport Services system SHOULD select paths
and configure protocols to optimize the tradeoff between delay, delay variation, and
efficient use of the available capacity based on the capacity profile specified. How this is realized
is implementation-specific. The capacity profile MAY also be used
to set markings on the wire for Protocol Stacks supporting this.
Recommendations for use with DSCP are provided below for each profile; note that
when a Connection is multiplexed, the guidelines in Section 6 of {{?RFC7657}} apply.

The following values are valid for the capacity profile:

  Default:
  : The application provides no information about its expected capacity
  profile. Transport Services systems that
  map the requested capacity profile onto per-connection DSCP signaling
  SHOULD assign the DSCP Default Forwarding {{?RFC2474}} Per Hop Behaviour (PHB).

  Scavenger:
  : The application is not interactive. It expects to send
  and/or receive data without any urgency. This can, for example, be used to
  select Protocol Stacks with scavenger transmission control and/or to assign
  the traffic to a lower-effort service. Transport Services systems that
  map the requested capacity profile onto per-connection DSCP signaling
  SHOULD assign the DSCP Less than Best Effort
  {{?RFC8622}} PHB.

  Low Latency/Interactive:
  : The application is interactive, and prefers loss to
  latency. Response time SHOULD be optimized at the expense of delay variation
  and efficient use of the available capacity when sending on this Connection. This can be
  used by the system to disable the coalescing of multiple small Messages into
  larger packets (Nagle's algorithm); to prefer immediate acknowledgment from
  the peer endpoint when supported by the underlying transport; and so on.
  Transport Services systems that map the requested capacity profile onto per-connection DSCP signaling without multiplexing SHOULD assign a DSCP Assured Forwarding (AF41,AF42,AF43,AF44) {{?RFC2597}} PHB. Inelastic traffic that is expected to conform to the configured network service rate could be mapped to the DSCP Expedited Forwarding {{?RFC3246}} or {{?RFC5865}} PHBs.

  Low Latency/Non-Interactive:
  : The application prefers loss to latency, but is
  not interactive. Response time SHOULD be optimized at the expense of delay
  variation and efficient use of the available capacity when sending on this Connection. Transport
  system implementations that map the requested capacity profile onto
  per-connection DSCP signaling without multiplexing SHOULD assign a DSCP
  Assured Forwarding (AF21,AF22,AF23,AF24) {{?RFC2597}} PHB.

  Constant-Rate Streaming:
  : The application expects to send/receive data at a
  constant rate after Connection establishment. Delay and delay variation SHOULD
  be minimized at the expense of efficient use of the available capacity.
  This implies that the Connection might fail if the Path is unable to maintain the desired rate.
  A transport can interpret this capacity profile as preferring a circuit
  breaker {{?RFC8084}} to a rate-adaptive congestion controller. Transport
  system implementations that map the requested capacity profile onto
  per-connection DSCP signaling without multiplexing SHOULD assign a DSCP
  Assured Forwarding (AF31,AF32,AF33,AF34) {{?RFC2597}} PHB.

  Capacity-Seeking:
  : The application expects to send/receive data at the
  maximum rate allowed by its congestion controller over a relatively long
  period of time. Transport Services systems that map the requested
  capacity profile onto per-connection DSCP signaling without multiplexing
  SHOULD assign a DSCP Assured Forwarding (AF11,AF12,AF13,AF14) {{?RFC2597}} PHB
  per Section 4.8 of {{?RFC4594}}.

The capacity profile for a selected Protocol Stack may be modified on a
per-Message basis using the Transmission Profile Message Property; see
{{send-profile}}.

### Policy for using Multipath Transports {#multipath-policy}

Name:
: multipathPolicy

Type:
: Enumeration

Default:
: Handover

This property specifies the local policy for transferring data across multiple paths between the same end hosts if Multipath Transport is not set to Disabled (see {{multipath-mode}}). Possible values are:

Handover:
: The Connection ought only to attempt to migrate between different paths when the original path is lost or becomes unusable. The thresholds used to declare a path unusable are implementation specific.

Interactive:
: The Connection ought only to attempt to minimize the latency for interactive traffic patterns by transmitting data across multiple paths when this is beneficial.
The goal of minimizing the latency will be balanced against the cost of each of these paths. Depending on the cost of the
lower-latency path, the scheduling might choose to use a higher-latency path. Traffic can be scheduled such that data may be transmitted
on multiple paths in parallel to achieve a lower latency. The specific scheduling algorithm is implementation-specific.

Aggregate:
: The Connection ought to attempt to use multiple paths in parallel to maximize available capacity and possibly overcome the capacity limitations of the individual paths. The actual strategy is implementation specific.

Note that this is a local choice â€“ the Remote Endpoint can choose a different policy.

### Bounds on Send or Receive Rate

Name:
: minSendRate / minRecvRate / maxSendRate / maxRecvRate

Type:
: Numeric (non-negative) or `Unlimited` / Numeric (non-negative) or `Unlimited` / Numeric (non-negative) or `Unlimited` / Numeric (non-negative) or `Unlimited`

Default:
: `Unlimited` / `Unlimited` / `Unlimited` / `Unlimited`

Numeric values of these properties specify an upper-bound rate that a transfer is not expected to
exceed (even if flow control and congestion control allow higher rates), and/or a
lower-bound application-layer rate below which the application does not deem
it will be useful. These rate values are measured at the application layer, i.e. do not consider the header overhead
from protocols used by the Transport Services system. The values are specified in bits per second,
and assumed to be measured over one-second time intervals. E.g., specifying a maxSendRate of X bits per second
means that, from the moment at which the property value is chosen, not more than X bits will be send in any
following second. The enumerated value `Unlimited` indicates that no bound is specified.
A Transport Services API could express `Unlimited` in an environment-typical way, e.g., as a Union type or special value.

### Group Connection Limit

Name:
: groupConnLimit

Type:
: Numeric (non-negative) or `Unlimited`

Default:
: `Unlimited`

If this property is Numeric, it controls the number of Connections that can be accepted from
a peer as new members of the Connection's group. Similar to `SetNewConnectionLimit`,
this limits the number of `ConnectionReceived` events that will occur, but constrained
to the group of the Connection associated with this property. For a multi-streaming transport,
this limits the number of allowed streams.  A Transport Services API
could express `Unlimited` in an environment-typical way, e.g., as a Union type or special value.

### Isolate Session {#isolate-session}
Name:
: isolateSession

Type:
: Boolean

Default:
: `false`

When set to `true`, this property will initiate new Connections using as little
cached information (such as session tickets or cookies) as possible from
previous Connections that are not in the same Connection Group. Any state generated by this
Connection will only be shared with Connections in the same Connection Group. Cloned Connections
will use saved state from within the Connection Group.
This is used for separating Connection Contexts as specified in {{Section 4.2.3 of I-D.ietf-taps-arch}}.

Note that this does not guarantee no leakage of information, as
implementations might not be able to fully isolate all caches (e.g. RTT
estimates). Note that this property could degrade Connection performance.

### Read-only Connection Properties {#read-only-conn-prop}

The following generic Connection Properties are read-only, i.e. they cannot be changed by an application.

#### Maximum Message Size Before Fragmentation or Segmentation {#conn-max-msg-notfrag}

Name:
: singularTransmissionMsgMaxLen

Type:
: Integer (non-negative) or `Not applicable`

This property, if applicable, represents the maximum Message size that can be
sent without incurring network-layer fragmentation at the sender.
It is specified as a number of bytes and is less than or equal to the
Maximum Message Size on Send.
It exposes a readable value to the application
based on the Maximum Packet Size (MPS). The value of this property can change over time (and can be updated by Datagram PLPMTUD {{?RFC8899}}).
This value allows a sending stack to avoid unwanted fragmentation at the
network-layer or segmentation by the transport layer before
choosing the message size and/or after a `SendError` occurs indicating
an attempt to send a Message that is too large.  A Transport Services API
could express `Not applicable` in an environment-typical way, e.g., as a Union type or special value.

#### Maximum Message Size on Send {#conn-max-msg-send}

Name:
: sendMsgMaxLen

Type:
: Integer (non-negative)

This property represents the maximum Message size that an application can send.
It is specified as the number of bytes.

#### Maximum Message Size on Receive {#conn-max-msg-recv}

Name:
: recvMsgMaxLen

Type:
: Integer (non-negative)

This property represents the maximum Message size that an application can receive.
It is specified as the number of bytes.

## TCP-specific Properties: User Timeout Option (UTO) {#tcp-uto}

These properties specify configurations for the TCP User Timeout Option (UTO).
This is a TCP-specific property, that is only used
in the case that TCP becomes the chosen transport protocol
and useful only if TCP is implemented in the Transport Services system.
Protocol-specific options could also be defined for other transport protocols.

These are included here because the feature `Suggest
timeout to the peer` is part of the minimal set of transport services
{{?RFC8923}}, where this feature was categorized as "functional".
This means that when a Transport Services system offers this feature,
the Transport Services API has to expose an interface to the application. Otherwise, the implementation might
violate assumptions by the application, which could cause the application to
fail.

All of the below properties are optional (e.g., it is possible to specify `User Timeout Enabled` as `true`,
but not specify an Advertised User Timeout value; in this case, the TCP default will be used).
These properties reflect the API extension specified in Section 3 of {{?RFC5482}}.

### Advertised User Timeout

Name:
: tcp.userTimeoutValue

Type:
: Integer (non-negative)

Default:
: the TCP default

This time value is advertised via the TCP User Timeout Option (UTO) {{?RFC5482}} at the Remote Endpoint
to adapt its own `Timeout for aborting Connection` (see {{conn-timeout}}) value.

### User Timeout Enabled

Name:
: tcp.userTimeoutEnabled

Type:
: Boolean

Default:
: `false`

This property controls whether the TCP UTO option is enabled for a
connection. This applies to both sending and receiving.

### Timeout Changeable

Name:
: tcp.userTimeoutChangeable

Type:
: Boolean

Default:
: `true`

This property controls whether the TCP `connTimeout` (see {{conn-timeout}})
can be changed
based on a UTO option received from the remote peer. This boolean becomes `false` when
`connTimeout` (see {{conn-timeout}}) is used.


## Connection Lifecycle Events

During the lifetime of a Connection there are events that can occur when configured.

### Soft Errors {#soft-errors}

Asynchronous introspection is also possible, via the `SoftError` event. This event
informs the application about the receipt and contents of an ICMP error message related to the Connection. This will only happen if the underlying Protocol Stack supports access to soft errors; however, even if the underlying stack supports it, there
is no guarantee that a soft error will be signaled.

~~~
Connection -> SoftError<>
~~~


### Path change {#conn-path-change}

This event notifies the application when at least one of the paths underlying a Connection has changed. Changes occur
on a single path when the PMTU changes as well as when multiple paths are used
and paths are added or removed, the set of local endpoints changes, or a handover has been performed.

~~~
Connection -> PathChange<>
~~~

# Data Transfer {#datatransfer}

Data is sent and received as Messages, which allows the application
to communicate the boundaries of the data being transferred.

## Messages and Framers {#msg}

Each Message has an optional Message Context, which allows adding Message Properties, identify `Send` events related to a specific Message or to inspect meta-data related to the Message sent. Framers can be used to extend or modify the Message data with additional information that can be processed at the receiver to detect message boundaries.


### Message Contexts {#msg-ctx}

Using the MessageContext object, the application can set and retrieve meta-data of the Message, including Message Properties (see {{message-props}}) and framing meta-data (see {{framing-meta}}).
Therefore, a MessageContext object can be passed to the `Send` action and is returned by each `Send` and `Receive` related event.

Message Properties can be set and queried using the Message Context:

~~~
MessageContext.add(property, value)
PropertyValue := MessageContext.get(property)
~~~

These Message Properties can be generic properties or Protocol-specific Properties.

For MessageContexts returned by `Send` events (see {{send-events}}) and `Receive` events (see {{receive-events}}), the application can query information about the Local and Remote Endpoint:

~~~
RemoteEndpoint := MessageContext.GetRemoteEndpoint()
LocalEndpoint := MessageContext.GetLocalEndpoint()
~~~

### Message Framers {#framing}

Although most applications communicate over a network using well-formed
Messages, the boundaries and metadata of the Messages are often not
directly communicated by the transport protocol itself. For example,
HTTP applications send and receive HTTP messages over a byte-stream
transport, requiring that the boundaries of HTTP messages be parsed
from the stream of bytes.

Message Framers allow extending a Connection's Protocol Stack to define
how to encapsulate or encode outbound Messages, and how to decapsulate
or decode inbound data into Messages. Message Framers allow message
boundaries to be preserved when using a Connection object, even when
using byte-stream transports. This is designed based on the fact
that many of the current application protocols evolved over TCP, which
does not provide message boundary preservation, and since many of these
protocols require message boundaries to function, each application layer
protocol has defined its own framing.

To use a Message Framer, the application adds it to its Preconnection object.
Then, the Message Framer can intercept all calls to `Send` or `Receive`
on a Connection to add Message semantics, in addition to interacting with
the setup and teardown of the Connection. A Framer can start sending data
before the application sends data if the framing protocol requires a prefix
or handshake (see {{?RFC9329}} for an example of such a framing protocol).

~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-framer-stack title="Protocol Stack showing a Message Framer"}

Note that while Message Framers add the most value when placed above
a protocol that otherwise does not preserve message boundaries, they can
also be used with datagram- or message-based protocols. In these cases,
they add a transformation to further encode or encapsulate,
and can potentially support packing multiple application-layer Messages
into individual transport datagrams.

The API to implement a Message Framer can vary depending on the implementation;
guidance on implementing Message Framers can be found in {{?I-D.ietf-taps-impl}}.

#### Adding Message Framers to Pre-Connections

The Message Framer object can be added to one or more Preconnections
to run on top of transport protocols. Multiple Framers can be added to a Preconnection;
in this case, the Framers operate as a framing stack, i.e. the last one added runs
first when framing outbound Messages, and last when parsing inbound data.

The following example adds a basic HTTP Message Framer to a Preconnection:

~~~
framer := NewHTTPMessageFramer()
Preconnection.AddFramer(framer)
~~~

Since Message Framers pass from Preconnection to Listener or Connection, addition of
Framers must happen before any operation that might result in the creation of a Connection.

#### Framing Meta-Data {#framing-meta}

When sending Messages, applications can add Framer-specific
properties to a MessageContext ({{msg-ctx}}) with the `add` action.
To avoid naming conflicts, the property
names SHOULD be prefixed with a namespace referencing the
framer implementation or the protocol it implements as described
in {{property-names}}.

This mechanism can be used, for example, to set the type of a Message for a TLV format.
The namespace of values is custom for each unique Message Framer.

~~~
messageContext := NewMessageContext()
messageContext.add(framer, key, value)
Connection.Send(messageData, messageContext)
~~~

When an application receives a MessageContext in a `Receive` event,
it can also look to see if a value was set by a specific Message Framer.

~~~
messageContext.get(framer, key) -> value
~~~

For example, if an HTTP Message Framer is used, the values could correspond
to HTTP headers:

~~~
httpFramer := NewHTTPMessageFramer()
...
messageContext := NewMessageContext()
messageContext.add(httpFramer, "accept", "text/html")
~~~


### Message Properties {#message-props}

Applications needing to annotate the Messages they send with extra information
(for example, to control how data is scheduled and processed by the transport protocols supporting the
Connection) can include this information in the Message Context passed to the `Send` action. For other uses of the Message Context, see {{msg-ctx}}.

Message Properties are per-Message, not per-`Send` if partial Messages
are sent ({{send-partial}}). All data blocks associated with a single Message
share properties specified in the Message Contexts. For example, it would not
make sense to have the beginning of a Message expire, but allow the end of a
Message to still be sent.

A MessageContext object contains metadata for the Messages to be sent or received.

~~~
messageData := "hello"
messageContext := NewMessageContext()
messageContext.add(parameter, value)
Connection.Send(messageData, messageContext)
~~~

The simpler form of `Send`, which does not take any MessageContext, is equivalent to passing a default MessageContext without adding any Message Properties.

If an application wants to override Message Properties for a specific Message,
it can acquire an empty MessageContext object and add all desired Message
Properties to that object. It can then reuse the same MessageContext object
for sending multiple Messages with the same properties.

Properties can be added to a MessageContext object only before the context is used
for sending. Once a MessageContext has been used with a `Send` action, further modifications
to the MessageContext object do not have any effect on this `Send` call. Message Properties
that are not added to a MessageContext object before using the context for sending will either
take a specific default value or be configured based on Selection or Connection Properties
of the Connection that is associated with the `Send` call.
This initialization behavior is defined per Message Property below.

The Message Properties could be inconsistent with the properties of the Protocol Stacks
underlying the Connection on which a given Message is sent. For example,
a Protocol Stack must be able to provide ordering if the `msgOrdered`
property of a Message is enabled. Sending a Message with Message Properties
inconsistent with the Selection Properties of the Connection yields an error.

If a Message Property contradicts a Connection Property, and
if this per-Message behavior can be supported, it overrides the Connection
Property for the specific Message. For example, if
`reliability` is set to `Require` and a protocol
with configurable per-Message reliability is used, setting
`msgReliable` to `false` for a particular Message will
allow this Message to be sent without any reliability guarantees. Changing
the `msgReliable` Message Property is only possible for
Connections that were established enabling the Selection Property
`perMsgReliability`. If the contradicting Message Property
cannot be supported by the Connection (such as requiring reliability
on a Connection that uses an unreliable protocol), the `Send` action
will result in a `SendError` event.

The following Message Properties are supported:

#### Lifetime {#msg-lifetime}

Name:
: msgLifetime

Type:
: Numeric (non-negative)

Default:
: infinite

The Lifetime specifies how long a particular Message can wait in the Transport Services system
before it is sent to the
Remote Endpoint. After this time, it is irrelevant and no longer needs to be
(re-)transmitted. This is a hint to the Transport Services system -- it is not guaranteed
that a Message will not be sent when its Lifetime has expired.

Setting a Message's Lifetime to infinite indicates that the application does
not wish to apply a time constraint on the transmission of the Message, but it does not express a need for
reliable delivery; reliability is adjustable per Message via the `perMsgReliability`
property (see {{msg-reliable-message}}). The type and units of Lifetime are implementation-specific.

#### Priority {#msg-priority}

Name:
: msgPriority

Type:
: Integer (non-negative)

Default:
: 100

This property specifies the priority of a Message, relative to other Messages sent over the
same Connection. A numerically lower value represents a higher priority.

A Message with Priority 2 will yield to a Message with Priority 1, which will
yield to a Message with Priority 0, and so on. Priorities can be used as a
sender-side scheduling construct only, or be used to specify priorities on the
wire for Protocol Stacks supporting prioritization.

Note that this property is not a per-Message override of `connPriority`
- see {{conn-priority}}. The priority properties might interact, but can be used
independently and be realized by different mechanisms; see {{priority-in-taps}}.

#### Ordered {#msg-ordered}

Name:
: msgOrdered

Type:
: Boolean

Default:
: the queried Boolean value of the Selection Property `preserveOrder` ({{prop-ordering}})

The order in which Messages were submitted for transmission via the `Send` action will be preserved on delivery via `Receive` events for all Messages on a Connection that have this Message Property set to `true`.

If `false`, the Message is delivered to the receiving application without preserving the ordering.
This property is used for protocols that support preservation of data ordering,
see {{prop-ordering}}, but allow out-of-order delivery for certain Messages, e.g., by multiplexing independent Messages onto
different streams.

If it is not configured by the application before sending, this property's default value
will be based on the Selection Property `preserveOrder` of the Connection
associated with the `Send` action.

#### Safely Replayable {#msg-safelyreplayable}

Name:
: safelyReplayable

Type:
: Boolean

Default:
: `false`

If `true`, `safelyReplayable` specifies that a Message is safe to send to the Remote Endpoint
more than once for a single `Send` action. It marks the data as safe for
certain 0-RTT establishment techniques, where retransmission of the 0-RTT data
could cause the remote application to receive the Message multiple times.

For protocols that do not protect against duplicated Messages,
e.g., UDP, all Messages need to be marked as "safely replayable" by enabling this property.
To enable protocol selection to choose such a protocol,
`safelyReplayable` needs to be added to the TransportProperties passed to the
Preconnection. If such a protocol was chosen, disabling `safelyReplayable` on
individual Messages MUST result in a `SendError`.

#### Final {#msg-final}

Name:
: final

Type:
: Boolean

Default:
: `false`

If `true`, this indicates a Message is the last that
the application will send on a Connection. This allows underlying protocols
to indicate to the Remote Endpoint that the Connection has been effectively
closed in the sending direction. For example, TCP-based Connections can
send a FIN once a Message marked as Final has been completely sent,
indicated by marking endOfMessage. Protocols that do not support signalling
the end of a Connection in a given direction will ignore this property.

A Final Message must always be sorted to the end of a list of Messages.
The Final property overrides Priority and any other property that would re-order
Messages. If another Message is sent after a Message marked as Final has already
been sent on a Connection, the `Send` action for the new Message will cause a `SendError` event.

#### Sending Corruption Protection Length {#msg-checksum}

Name:
: msgChecksumLen

Type:
: Integer (non-negative) or `Full Coverage`

Default:
: `Full Coverage`

If this property is an Integer, it specifies the minimum length of the section of a sent Message,
starting from byte 0, that the application requires to be delivered without
corruption due to lower layer errors. It is used to specify options for simple
integrity protection via checksums. A value of 0 means that no checksum
needs to be calculated, and the enumerated value `Full Coverage` means
that the entire Message needs to be protected by a checksum. Only `Full Coverage` is
guaranteed, any other requests are advisory, which may result in `Full Coverage` being applied.

#### Reliable Data Transfer (Message) {#msg-reliable-message}

Name:
: msgReliable

Type:
: Boolean

Default:
: the queried Boolean value of the Selection Property `reliability` ({{prop-reliable}})

When true, this property specifies that a Message should be sent in such a way
that the transport protocol ensures all data is received by the Remote Endpoint.
Changing the `msgReliable` property on Messages
is only possible for Connections that were established enabling the Selection Property `perMsgReliability`.
When this is not the case, changing `msgReliable` will generate an error.

Disabling this property indicates that the Transport Services system could disable retransmissions
or other reliability mechanisms for this particular Message, but such disabling is not guaranteed.

If it is not configured by the application before sending, this property's default value
will be based on the Selection Property `reliability` of the Connection
associated with the `Send` action.

#### Message Capacity Profile Override {#send-profile}

Name:
: msgCapacityProfile

Type:
: Enumeration

Default:
: inherited from the Connection Property `connCapacityProfile` ({{prop-cap-profile}})

This enumerated property specifies the application's preferred tradeoffs for
sending this Message; it is a per-Message override of the `connCapacityProfile`
Connection Property (see {{prop-cap-profile}}).
If it is not configured by the application before sending, this property's default value
will be based on the Connection Property `connCapacityProfile` of the Connection
associated with the `Send` action.

#### No Network-Layer Fragmentation {#send-singular}

Name:
: noFragmentation

Type:
: Boolean

Default:
: `false`

This property specifies that a Message should be sent and received
without network-layer fragmentation, if possible. It can be used
to avoid network layer fragmentation when transport segmentation is preferred.

This only takes effect when the transport uses a network layer that supports this functionality.
When it does take effect, setting this property to
`true` will cause the sender to avoid network-layer source fragmentation.
When using IPv4, this will result in the Don't Fragment bit being set in the IP header.

Attempts to send a Message with this property that result in a size greater than the
transport's current estimate of its maximum packet size (`singularTransmissionMsgMaxLen`)
can result in transport segmentation when permitted, or in a `SendError`.

Note: noSegmentation is used when it is desired to only send a Message within
a single network packet.

#### No Segmentation {#no-transport-fragmentation}

Name:
: noSegmentation

Type:
: Boolean

Default:
: `false`

When set to `true`, this property requests the transport layer
to not provide segmentation of Messages larger than the
maximum size permitted by the network layer, and also
to avoid network-layer source fragmentation of Messages.
When running over IPv4, setting this property to
`true` will result in a sending endpoint setting the
Don't Fragment bit in the IPv4 header of packets generated by the
transport layer.

An
attempt to send a Message that results in a size greater than the
transport's current estimate of its maximum packet size (`singularTransmissionMsgMaxLen`)
will result in a `SendError`.
This only takes effect when the transport and network layer
support this functionality.

## Sending Data {#sending}

Once a Connection has been established, it can be used for sending Messages.
By default, `Send` enqueues a complete Message,
and takes optional per-Message properties (see {{send-basic}}). All `Send` actions
are asynchronous, and deliver events (see {{send-events}}). Sending partial
Messages for streaming large data is also supported (see {{send-partial}}).

Messages are sent on a Connection using the `Send` action:

~~~
Connection.Send(messageData, messageContext?, endOfMessage?)
~~~

where `messageData` is the data object to send, and `messageContext` allows
adding Message Properties, identifying `Send` events related to a specific
Message or inspecting meta-data related to the Message sent (see {{msg-ctx}}).

The optional endOfMessage parameter supports partial sending and is described in
{{send-partial}}.


### Basic Sending {#send-basic}

The most basic form of sending on a Connection involves enqueuing a single Data
block as a complete Message with default Message Properties.

~~~
messageData := "hello"
Connection.Send(messageData)
~~~

The interpretation of a Message to be sent is dependent on the implementation, and
on the constraints on the Protocol Stacks implied by the Connectionâ€™s transport properties.
For example, a Message could be the payload of
a single datagram for a UDP Connection; or an HTTP Request for an HTTP
Connection.

Some transport protocols can deliver arbitrarily sized Messages, but other
protocols constrain the maximum Message size. Applications can query the
Connection Property `sendMsgMaxLen` ({{conn-max-msg-send}}) to determine the maximum size
allowed for a single Message. If a Message is too large to fit in the Maximum Message
Size for the Connection, the `Send` will fail with a `SendError` event ({{send-error}}). For
example, it is invalid to send a Message over a UDP connection that is larger than
the available datagram sending size.

### Send Events {#send-events}

Like all actions in Transport Services API, the `Send` action is asynchronous. There are
several events that can be delivered in response to sending a Message.
Exactly one event (`Sent`, `Expired`, or `SendError`) will be delivered in response
to each call to `Send`.

Note that if partial `Send` calls are used ({{send-partial}}), there will still be exactly
one `Send` event delivered for each call to `Send`. For example, if a Message
expired while two requests to `Send` data for that Message are outstanding,
there will be two `Expired` events delivered.

The Transport Services API should allow the application to correlate which `Send` action resulted
in a particular `Send` event. The manner in which this correlation is indicated
is implementation-specific.

#### Sent {#sent}

~~~
Connection -> Sent<messageContext>
~~~

The `Sent` event occurs when a previous `Send` call has completed, i.e., when
the data derived from the Message has been passed down or through the
underlying Protocol Stack and is no longer the responsibility of
the Transport Services API. The exact disposition of the Message (i.e.,
whether it has actually been transmitted, moved into a buffer on the network
interface, moved into a kernel buffer, and so on) when the `Sent` event occurs
is implementation-specific. The `Sent` event contains a reference to the Message
Context of the Message to which it applies.

`Sent` events allow an application to obtain an understanding of the amount
of buffering it creates. That is, if an application calls the `Send` action multiple
times without waiting for a `Sent` event, it has created more buffer inside the
Transport Services system than an application that always waits for the `Sent` event before
calling the next `Send` action.

#### Expired {#expired}

~~~
Connection -> Expired<messageContext>
~~~

The `Expired` event occurs when a previous `Send` action expired before completion;
i.e. when the Message was not sent before its Lifetime (see {{msg-lifetime}})
expired. This is separate from `SendError`, as it is an expected behavior for
partially reliable transports. The `Expired` event contains a reference to the
Message Context of the Message to which it applies.

#### SendError {#send-error}

~~~
Connection -> SendError<messageContext, reason?>
~~~

A `SendError` occurs when a Message was not sent due to an error condition:
an attempt to send a Message that is too large for the system and
Protocol Stack to handle, some failure of the underlying Protocol Stack, or a
set of Message Properties not consistent with the Connection's transport
properties. The `SendError` contains a reference to the Message Context of the
Message to which it applies.

### Partial Sends {#send-partial}

It is not always possible for an application to send all data associated with
a Message in a single `Send` action. The Message data might be too large for
the application to hold in memory at one time, or the length of the Message
might be unknown or unbounded.

Partial Message sending is supported by passing an endOfMessage Boolean
parameter to the `Send` action. This value is always `true` by default, and
the simpler forms of `Send` are equivalent to passing `true` for endOfMessage.

The following example sends a Message in two separate calls to `Send`.

~~~
messageContext := NewMessageContext()
messageContext.add(parameter, value)

messageData := "hel"
endOfMessage := false
Connection.Send(messageData, messageContext, endOfMessage)

messageData := "lo"
endOfMessage := true
Connection.Send(messageData, messageContext, endOfMessage)
~~~

All data sent with the same MessageContext object will be treated as belonging
to the same Message, and will constitute an in-order series until the
endOfMessage is marked.

### Batching Sends {#send-batching}

To reduce the overhead of sending multiple small Messages on a Connection, the
application could batch several `Send` actions together. This provides a hint to
the system that the sending of these Messages ought to be coalesced when possible,
and that sending any of the batched Messages can be delayed until the last Message
in the batch is enqueued.

The semantics for starting and ending a batch can be implementation-specific, but need
to allow multiple `Send` actions to be enqueued.

~~~
Connection.StartBatch()
Connection.Send(messageData)
Connection.Send(messageData)
Connection.EndBatch()
~~~

### Send on Active Open: InitiateWithSend {#initiate-and-send}

For application-layer protocols where the Connection initiator also sends the
first Message, the `InitiateWithSend` action combines Connection initiation with
a first Message sent:

~~~
Connection := Preconnection.InitiateWithSend(messageData,
                                             messageContext?,
                                             timeout?)
~~~

Whenever possible, a MessageContext should be provided to declare the Message passed to `InitiateWithSend`
as "safely replayable" using the `safelyReplayable` property. This allows the Transport Services system to make use of 0-RTT establishment in case this is supported
by the available Protocol Stacks. When the selected stack(s) do not support transmitting data upon connection
establishment, `InitiateWithSend` is identical to `Initiate` followed by `Send`.

Neither partial sends nor send batching are supported by `InitiateWithSend`.

The events that are sent after `InitiateWithSend` are equivalent to those
that would be sent by an invocation of `Initiate` followed immediately by an
invocation of `Send`, with the caveat that a send failure that occurs because
the Connection could not be established will not result in a
`SendError` separate from the `EstablishmentError` signaling the failure of Connection
establishment.

### Priority and the Transport Services API  {#priority-in-taps}

The Transport Services API provides two properties to allow a sender
to signal the relative priority of data transmission: `msgPriority`
{{msg-priority}} and `connPriority` {{conn-priority}}.
These properties are designed to allow the expression
and implementation of a wide variety of approaches to transmission priority in
the transport and application layer, including those which do not appear on
the wire (affecting only sender-side transmission scheduling) as well as those
that do (e.g. {{?RFC9218}}.
A Transport Services system gives no guarantees about how its expression of
relative priorities will be realized.

The Transport Services API does order `connPriority` over
`msgPriority`. In the absence of other externalities
(e.g., transport-layer flow control), a priority 1 Message on a priority 0
Connection will be sent before a priority 0 Message on a priority 1
Connection in the same group.

## Receiving Data {#receiving}

Once a Connection is established, it can be used for receiving data (unless the
`direction` property is set to `unidirectional send`). As with
sending, the data is received in Messages. Receiving is an asynchronous
operation, in which each call to `Receive` enqueues a request to receive new
data from the Connection. Once data has been received, or an error is encountered,
an event will be delivered to complete any pending `Receive` requests (see {{receive-events}}).
If Messages arrive at the Transport Services system before `Receive` requests are issued,
ensuing `Receive` requests will first operate on these Messages before awaiting any further Messages.

### Enqueuing Receives

 `Receive` takes two parameters to specify the length of data that an application
is willing to receive, both of which are optional and have default values if not
specified.

~~~
Connection.Receive(minIncompleteLength?, maxLength?)
~~~

By default, `Receive` will try to deliver complete Messages in a single event ({{receive-complete}}).

The application can set a minIncompleteLength value to indicate the smallest partial
Message data size in bytes to be delivered in response to this `Receive`. By default,
this value is infinite, which means that only complete Messages should be delivered (see {{receive-partial}}
and {{framing}} for more information on how this is accomplished).
If this value is set to some smaller value, the associated receive event will be triggered
only when at least that many bytes are available, or the Message is complete with fewer
bytes, or the system needs to free up memory. Applications SHOULD always
check the length of the data delivered to the receive event and not assume
it will be as long as minIncompleteLength in the case of shorter complete Messages
or memory issues.

The maxLength argument indicates the maximum size of a Message in bytes
that the application is currently prepared to receive. The default
value for maxLength is infinite. If an incoming Message is larger than the
minimum of this size and the maximum Message size on receive for
the Connection's Protocol Stack, it will be delivered via `ReceivedPartial`
events ({{receive-partial}}).

Note that maxLength does not guarantee that the application will receive that many
bytes if they are available; the Transport Services API could return `ReceivedPartial` events with less
data than maxLength according to implementation constraints. Note also that maxLength
and minIncompleteLength are intended only to manage buffering, and are not interpreted
as a receiver preference for Message reordering.

### Receive Events {#receive-events}

Each call to `Receive` will be paired with a single `Receive` event. This allows an application
to provide backpressure to the transport stack when it is temporarily not ready to receive Messages.
For example, an application that will later be able to handle multiple receive events at the same time
can make multiple calls to `Receive` without waiting for, or processing, any receive events. An application
that is temporarily unable to process received events for a connection could refrain from calling `Receive`
or delay calling it. This would lead to a build-up of unread data, which, in turn, could result in
backpressure to the sender via a transport protocol's flow control.

The Transport Services API should allow the application to correlate which call to `Receive` resulted
in a particular `Receive` event. The manner in which this correlation is indicated
is implementation-specific.

#### Received {#receive-complete}

~~~
Connection -> Received<messageData, messageContext>
~~~

A `Received` event indicates the delivery of a complete Message.
It contains two objects, the received bytes as `messageData`, and the metadata and properties of the received Message as `messageContext`.

The `messageData` value provides access to the bytes that were received for this Message, along with the length of the byte array.
The `messageContext` value is provided to enable retrieving metadata about the Message and referring to the Message. The MessageContext object is described in {{msg-ctx}}.

See {{framing}} for handling Message framing in situations where the Protocol
Stack only provides a byte-stream transport.

#### ReceivedPartial {#receive-partial}

~~~
Connection -> ReceivedPartial<messageData, messageContext,
                              endOfMessage>
~~~

If a complete Message cannot be delivered in one event, one part of the Message
can be delivered with a `ReceivedPartial` event. To continue to receive more
of the same Message, the application must invoke `Receive` again.

Multiple invocations of `ReceivedPartial` deliver data for the same Message by
passing the same MessageContext, until the endOfMessage flag is delivered or a
 `ReceiveError` occurs. All partial blocks of a single Message are delivered in
order without gaps. This event does not support delivering non-contiguous partial
Messages. If, for example, Message A is divided into three pieces (A1, A2, A3) and
Message B is divided into three pieces (B1, B2, B3), and preserveOrder is not Required,
the `ReceivedPartial` could deliver them in a sequence like this: A1, B1, B2, A2, A3, B3,
because the MessageContext allows the application to identify the pieces as belonging
to Message A and B, respectively. However, a sequence like: A1, A3 will never occur.

If the minIncompleteLength in the Receive request was set to be infinite (indicating
a request to receive only complete Messages), the `ReceivedPartial` event could still be
delivered if one of the following conditions is true:

* the underlying Protocol Stack supports message boundary preservation, and
  the size of the Message is larger than the buffers available for a single
  Message;
* the underlying Protocol Stack does not support message boundary
  preservation, and the Message Framer (see {{framing}}) cannot determine
  the end of the Message using the buffer space it has available; or
* the underlying Protocol Stack does not support message boundary
  preservation, and no Message Framer was supplied by the application

Note that in the absence of message boundary preservation or
a Message Framer, all bytes received on the Connection will be represented as one
large Message of indeterminate length.

In the following example, an application only wants to receive up to 1000 bytes
at a time from a Connection. If a 1500-byte Message arrives, it would receive
the Message in two separate `ReceivedPartial` events.

~~~
Connection.Receive(1, 1000)

// Receive first 1000 bytes, message is incomplete
Connection -> ReceivedPartial<messageData(1000 bytes),
                              messageContext, false>

Connection.Receive(1, 1000)

// Receive last 500 bytes, message is now complete
Connection -> ReceivedPartial<messageData(500 bytes),
                              messageContext, true>
~~~

#### ReceiveError {#receive-error}

~~~
Connection -> ReceiveError<messageContext, reason?>
~~~

A `ReceiveError` occurs when data is received by the underlying Protocol Stack
that cannot be fully retrieved or parsed, and when it is useful for the application
to be notified of such errors. For example, a `ReceiveError` can
indicate that a Message (identified via the `messageContext` value)
that was being partially received previously, but had not
completed, encountered an error and will not be completed. This can be useful
for an application, which might wish to use this error as a hint to remove
previously received Message parts from memory. As another example,
if an incoming Message does not fulfill the `recvChecksumLen` property
(see {{conn-recv-checksum}}),
an application can use this error as a hint to inform the peer application
to adjust the `msgChecksumLen` property (see {{msg-checksum}}).

In contrast, internal protocol reception errors (e.g., loss causing retransmissions
in TCP) are not signalled by this event. Conditions that irrevocably lead to
the termination of the Connection are signaled using `ConnectionError`
(see {{termination}}).


### Receive Message Properties {#recv-meta}

Each Message Context could contain metadata from protocols in the Protocol Stack;
which metadata is available is Protocol Stack dependent. These are exposed through additional read-only Message Properties that can be queried from the MessageContext object (see {{msg-ctx}}) passed by the receive event.
The following metadata values are supported:

#### UDP(-Lite)-specific Property: ECN {#receive-ecn}

When available, Message metadata carries the value of the Explicit Congestion
Notification (ECN) field. This information can be used for logging and debugging,
and for building applications that need access to information about
the transport internals for their own operation. This property is specific to UDP
and UDP-Lite because these protocols do not implement congestion control,
and hence expose this functionality to the application (see {{?RFC8293}},
following the guidance in {{?RFC8085}})

#### Early Data {#receive-early}

In some cases it can be valuable to know whether data was read as part of early
data transfer (before Connection establishment has finished). This is useful if
applications need to treat early data separately,
e.g., if early data has different security properties than data sent after
connection establishment. In the case of TLS 1.3, client early data can be replayed
maliciously (see {{?RFC8446}}). Thus, receivers might wish to perform additional
checks for early data to ensure it is safely replayable. If TLS 1.3 is available
and the recipient Message was sent as part of early data, the corresponding metadata carries
a flag indicating as such. If early data is enabled, applications should check this metadata
field for Messages received during Connection establishment and respond accordingly.

#### Receiving Final Messages

The Message Context can indicate whether or not this Message is
the Final Message on a Connection. For any Message that is marked as Final,
the application can assume that there will be no more Messages received on the
Connection once the Message has been completely delivered. This corresponds
to the `final` property that can be marked on a sent Message, see {{msg-final}}.

Some transport protocols and peers do not support signaling of the `final` property.
Applications therefore  SHOULD NOT rely on receiving a Message marked Final to know
that the sending endpoint is done sending on a Connection.

Any calls to `Receive` once the Final Message has been delivered will result in errors.

# Connection Termination {#termination}

A Connection can be terminated i) by the Local Endpoint (i.e., the application calls the `Close`, `CloseGroup`, `Abort` or `AbortGroup` action), ii) by the Remote Endpoint (i.e., the remote application calls the `Close`, `CloseGroup`, `Abort` or `AbortGroup` action), or iii) because of an error (e.g., a timeout). A local call of the `Close` action will
cause the Connection to either send a `Closed` event or a `ConnectionError` event, and a local call of
the `CloseGroup` action will cause all of the Connections in the group to either send a `Closed` event
or a `ConnectionError` event. A local call of the `Abort` action will cause the Connection to send
a `ConnectionError` event, indicating local `Abort` as a reason, and a local call of the `AbortGroup` action
will cause all of the Connections in the group to send a `ConnectionError` event, indicating local `Abort`
as a reason.

Remote action calls map to events similar to local calls (e.g., a remote `Close` causes the
Connection to either send a `Closed` event or a `ConnectionError` event), but, different from local action calls,
it is not guaranteed that such events will indeed be invoked. When an application needs to free resources
associated with a Connection, it ought not to therefore rely on the invocation of such events due to
termination calls from the Remote Endpoint, but instead use the local termination actions.

`Close` terminates a Connection after satisfying all the requirements that were
specified regarding the delivery of Messages that the application has already
given to the Transport Services system. Upon successfully satisfying all these
requirements, the Connection will send the `Closed` event. For example, if reliable delivery was requested
for a Message handed over before calling `Close`, the `Closed` event will signify
that this Message has indeed been delivered. This action does not affect any other Connection
in the same Connection Group.

An application MUST NOT assume that it can receive any further data on a Connection
for which it has called `Close`, even if such data is already in flight.

~~~
Connection.Close()
~~~

The `Closed` event informs the application that a `Close` action has successfully
completed, or that the Remote Endpoint has closed the Connection.
There is no guarantee that a remote `Close` will be signaled.


~~~
Connection -> Closed<>
~~~

`Abort` terminates a Connection without delivering any remaining Messages. This action does
not affect any other Connection that is entangled with this one in a Connection Group.
When the `Abort` action has finished, the Connection will send a `ConnectionError` event,
indicating local `Abort` as a reason.

~~~
Connection.Abort()
~~~

`CloseGroup` gracefully terminates a Connection and any other Connections in the
same Connection Group. For example, all of the Connections in a
group might be streams of a single session for a multistreaming protocol; closing the entire
group will close the underlying session. See also {{groups}}. All Connections in the group
will send a `Closed` event when the `CloseGroup` action was successful.
As with `Close`, any Messages
remaining to be processed on a Connection will be handled prior to closing.

~~~
Connection.CloseGroup()
~~~

`AbortGroup` terminates a Connection and any other Connections that are
in the same Connection Group without delivering any remaining Messages.
When the `AbortGroup` action has finished, all Connections in the group will
send a `ConnectionError` event, indicating local `Abort` as a reason.

~~~
Connection.AbortGroup()
~~~

A `ConnectionError` informs the application that: 1) data could not be delivered to the
peer after a timeout,
or 2) the Connection has been aborted (e.g., because the peer has called `Abort`).
There is no guarantee that an `Abort` from the peer will be signaled.

~~~
Connection -> ConnectionError<reason?>
~~~


# Connection State and Ordering of Operations and Events

This Transport Services API is designed to be independent of an implementation's
concurrency model.  The details of how exactly actions are handled, and how
events are dispatched, are implementation dependent.

Each transition of Connection state is associated with one of more events:

- `Ready<>` occurs when a Connection created with `Initiate` or
  `InitiateWithSend` transitions to Established state.

- `ConnectionReceived<>` occurs when a Connection created with `Listen`
  transitions to Established state.

- `RendezvousDone<>` occurs when a Connection created with `Rendezvous`
  transitions to Established state.

- `Closed<>` occurs when a Connection transitions to Closed state without error.

- `EstablishmentError<>` occurs when a Connection created with `Initiate` transitions
  from Establishing state to Closed state due to an error.

- `ConnectionError<>` occurs when a Connection transitions to Closed state due to
  an error in all other circumstances.

The following diagram shows the possible states of a Connection and the
events that occur upon a transition from one state to another.

~~~~~~~~~~

              (*)                               (**)
Establishing -----> Established -----> Closing ------> Closed
     |                                                   ^
     |                                                   |
     +---------------------------------------------------+
                  EstablishmentError<>

(*) Ready<>, ConnectionReceived<>, RendezvousDone<>
(**) Closed<>, ConnectionError<>

~~~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-connstates title="Connection State Diagram"}

The Transport Services API  provides the following guarantees about the ordering of
 operations:

- `Sent<>` events will occur on a Connection in the order in which the Messages
  were sent (i.e., delivered to the kernel or to the network interface,
  depending on implementation).

- `Received<>` will never occur on a Connection before it is Established; i.e.
  before a `Ready<>` event on that Connection, or a `ConnectionReceived<>` or
  `RendezvousDone<>` containing that Connection.

- No events will occur on a Connection after it is closed; i.e., after a
  `Closed<>` event, an `EstablishmentError<>` or `ConnectionError<>` will not occur on that Connection. To
  ensure this ordering, `Closed<>` will not occur on a Connection while other
  events on the Connection are still locally outstanding (i.e., known to the
  Transport Services API and waiting to be dealt with by the application).


# IANA Considerations

This document has no actions for IANA.
Later versions of this document might create IANA registries for generic transport property names and transport property namespaces (see {{property-names}}).

# Privacy and Security Considerations {#privacy-security}

This document describes a generic API for interacting with a Transport Services system.
Part of this API includes configuration details for transport security protocols, as discussed
in {{security-parameters}}. It does not recommend use (or disuse) of specific
algorithms or protocols. Any API-compatible transport security protocol ought to work in a Transport Services system.
Security considerations for these protocols are discussed in the respective specifications.

The described API is used to exchange information between an application and the Transport Services system. While
it is not necessarily expected that both systems are implemented by the same authority, it is expected
that the Transport Services implementation is either provided as a library that is selected by the application
from a trusted party, or that it is part of the operating system that the application also relies on for
other tasks.

In either case, the Transport Services API is an internal interface that is used to exchange information locally between two systems.
However, as the Transport Services system is responsible for network communication, it is in the position to
potentially share any information provided by the application with the network or another communication peer.
Most of the information provided over the Transport Services API are useful to configure and select protocols and paths
and are not necessarily privacy-sensitive. Still, some information could be privacy sensitive because
it might reveal usage characteristics and habits of the user of an application.

Of course any communication over a network reveals usage characteristics, because all
packets, as well as their timing and size, are part of the network-visible wire image {{?RFC8546}}. However,
the selection of a protocol and its configuration also impacts which information is visible, potentially in
clear text, and which other entities can access it. In most cases, information provided for protocol and path selection
does not directly translate to information that can be observed by network devices on the path.
However, there might be specific configuration
information that is intended for path exposure, e.g., a DiffServ codepoint setting, that is either provided
directly by the application or indirectly configured for a traffic profile.

Applications should be aware that a single communication attempt can lead to more than one connection establishment procedure.
This is the case, for example, when the Transport Services system also executes name resolution, when support mechanisms such as
TURN or ICE are used to establish connectivity, if protocols or paths are raced, or if a path fails and
fallback or re-establishment is supported in the Transport Services system. Applications should take special
care when using 0-RTT session resumption (see {{prop-0rtt}}), as early data sent across multiple paths during
connection establishment could reveal information that can be used to correlate endpoints on these paths.

Applications should also take care to not assume that all data received using the Transport Services API is always
complete or well-formed. Specifically, Messages that are received partially {{receive-partial}} could be a source
of truncation attacks if applications do not distinguish between partial Messages and complete Messages.

The Transport Services API explicitly does not require the application to resolve names, though there is
a tradeoff between early and late binding of addresses to names. Early binding
allows the Transport Services implementation to reduce Connection setup latency, at the cost
of potentially limited scope for alternate path discovery during Connection
establishment, as well as potential additional information leakage about
application interest when used with a resolution method (such as DNS without
TLS) which does not protect query confidentiality.

These communication activities are not different from what is used today. However,
the goal of a Transport Services system is to support
such mechanisms as a generic service within the transport layer. This enables applications to more dynamically
benefit from innovations and new protocols in the transport, although it reduces transparency of the
underlying communication actions to the application itself. The Transport Services API is designed such that protocol and path selection
can be limited to a small and controlled set if the application requires this or to implement a security policy.
can be limited to a small and controlled set if required by the application to perform a function or to provide security.
Further,
introspection on the properties of Connection objects allows an application to determine which protocol(s) and path(s) are in use.
A Transport Services system SHOULD provide a facility logging the communication events of each Connection.

# Implementation Mapping {#implmapping}

The way the concepts from this abstract API map into concrete APIs in a
given language on a given platform largely depends on the features and norms of
the language and the platform. Actions could be implemented as functions or
method calls, for instance, and events could be implemented via event queues,
handler functions or classes, communicating sequential processes, or other
asynchronous calling conventions.

## Types

The basic types mentioned in {{notation}} typically have natural
correspondences in practical programming languages, perhaps constrained by
implementation-specific limitations. For example:

- An Integer can typically be represented in C by an `int` or `long`, subject
  to the underlying platform's ranges for each.
- In C, a Tuple may be represented as a `struct` with one member for each of
  the value types in the ordered grouping. In Python, by contrast, a Tuple may
  be represented as a `tuple`, a sequence of dynamically-typed
  elements.
- A Set may be represented as a `std::set` in C++ or as a `set` in
  Python. In C, it may be represented as an array or as a higher-level data
  structure with appropriate accessors defined.

The objects described in {{notation}} can similarly be represented in
different ways depending on which programming language is used. Objects
like Preconnections, Connections, and Listeners can be long-lived, and
benefit from using object-oriented constructs. Note that in C, these
objects may need to provide a way to release or free their underlying
memory when the application is done using them. For example, since a
Preconnection can be used to initiate multiple Connections, it is the
responsibility of the application to clean up the Preconnection memory
if necessary.

## Events and Errors

This specification treats events and errors similarly. Errors, just as any
other events, may occur asynchronously in network applications. However,
implementations of this API may report errors synchronously,
according to the error handling idioms of the implementation
platform, where they can be immediately detected, such as by generating an
exception when attempting to initiate a Connection with inconsistent
Transport Properties. An error can provide an optional reason to the
application with further details about why the error occurred.

## Time Duration

Time duration types are implementation-specific.
For instance, it could be a number of seconds, number of milliseconds, or a `struct timeval` in C or a user-defined `Duration` class in C++.

# Convenience Functions

## Adding Preference Properties {#preference-conv}

TransportProperties will frequently need to set
Selection Properties of type `Preference`, therefore implementations can provide special actions
for adding each preference level i.e, `TransportProperties.Set(some_property, avoid)
is equivalent to `TransportProperties.Avoid(some_property)`:

~~~
TransportProperties.Require(property)
TransportProperties.Prefer(property)
TransportProperties.NoPreference(property)
TransportProperties.Avoid(property)
TransportProperties.Prohibit(property)
~~~

## Transport Property Profiles {#property-profiles}

To ease the use of the Transport Services API, implementations
can provide a mechanism to create Transport Property objects (see {{selection-props}})
that are preconfigured with frequently used sets of properties; the following are
in common use in current applications:

### reliable-inorder-stream

This profile provides reliable, in-order transport service with
congestion control.
TCP is an example of a protocol that provides this service.
It should consist of the following properties:

 | Property                 | Value     |
 |:-------------------------|:----------|
 | reliability              | require   |
 | preserveOrder            | require   |
 | congestionControl        | require   |
 | preserveMsgBoundaries    | no preference      |
{: #tabrio title="reliable-inorder-stream preferences"}

### reliable-message

This profile provides message-preserving, reliable, in-order
transport service with congestion control.
SCTP is an example of a protocol that provides this service.
It should consist of the following properties:

 | Property                 | Value     |
 |:-------------------------|:----------|
 | reliability              | require   |
 | preserveOrder            | require   |
 | congestionControl        | require   |
 | preserveMsgBoundaries    | require   |
{: #tabrm title="reliable-message preferences"}

### unreliable-datagram

This profile provides a datagram transport service without any
reliability guarantee.
An example of a protocol that provides this service is UDP.
It consists of the following properties:

 | Property                 | Value     |
 |:-------------------------|:----------|
 | reliability              | avoid     |
 | preserveOrder            | avoid     |
 | congestionControl        | no preference      |
 | preserveMsgBoundaries    | require   |
 | safelyReplayable         | true      |
{: #tabud title="unreliable-datagram preferences"}

Applications that choose this Transport Property Profile would
avoid the additional latency that could be introduced
by retransmission or reordering in a transport protocol.

Applications that choose this Transport Property Profile to reduce latency
should also consider setting an appropriate capacity profile Property,
see {{prop-cap-profile}} and might benefit from controlling checksum
coverage, see {{prop-checksum-control-send}} and {{prop-checksum-control-receive}}.


# Relationship to the Minimal Set of Transport Services for End Systems

{{?RFC8923}} identifies a minimal set of transport services that end systems should offer. These services make all non-security-related transport features of TCP, MPTCP, UDP, UDP-Lite, SCTP and LEDBAT available that 1) require interaction with the application, and 2) do not get in the way of a possible implementation over TCP (or, with limitations, UDP). The following text explains how this minimal set is reflected in the present API. For brevity, it is based on the list in Section 4.1 of {{?RFC8923}}, updated according to the discussion in Section 5 of {{?RFC8923}}. The present API covers all elements of this section.
This list is a subset of the transport features in Appendix A of {{?RFC8923}}, which refers to the primitives in "pass 2" (Section 4) of {{?RFC8303}} for further details on the implementation with TCP, MPTCP, UDP, UDP-Lite, SCTP and LEDBAT.

* Connect:
`Initiate` action ({{initiate}}).

* Listen:
`Listen` action ({{listen}}).

* Specify number of attempts and/or timeout for the first establishment Message:
`timeout` parameter of `Initiate` ({{initiate}}) or `InitiateWithSend` action ({{initiate-and-send}}).

* Disable MPTCP:
`multipath` property ({{multipath-mode}}).

* Hand over a Message to reliably transfer (possibly multiple times) before connection establishment:
`InitiateWithSend` action ({{initiate-and-send}}).

* Change timeout for aborting connection (using retransmit limit or time value):
`connTimeout` property, using a time value ({{conn-timeout}}).

* Timeout event when data could not be delivered for too long:
`ConnectionError` event ({{termination}}).

* Suggest timeout to the peer:
See "TCP-specific Properties: User Timeout Option (UTO)" ({{tcp-uto}}).

* Notification of ICMP error message arrival:
`softErrorNotify` ({{prop-soft-error}}) and `SoftError` event ({{soft-errors}}).

* Choose a scheduler to operate between streams of an association:
`connScheduler` property ({{conn-scheduler}}).

* Configure priority or weight for a scheduler:
`connPriority` property ({{conn-priority}}).

* "Specify checksum coverage used by the sender" and "Disable checksum when sending":
`msgChecksumLen` property ({{msg-checksum}}) and `fullChecksumSend` property ({{prop-checksum-control-send}}).

* "Specify minimum checksum coverage required by receiver" and "Disable checksum requirement when receiving":
`recvChecksumLen` property ({{conn-recv-checksum}}) and `fullChecksumRecv` property ({{prop-checksum-control-receive}}).

* "Specify DF field":
`noFragmentation` property ({{send-singular}}).

* Get max. transport-message size that may be sent using a non-fragmented IP packet from the configured interface:
`singularTransmissionMsgMaxLen` property ({{conn-max-msg-notfrag}}).

* Get max. transport-message size that may be received from the configured interface:
`recvMsgMaxLen` property ({{conn-max-msg-recv}}).

* Obtain ECN field:
This is a read-only Message Property of the MessageContext object (see "UDP(-Lite)-specific Property: ECN" {{receive-ecn}}).

* "Specify DSCP field", "Disable Nagle algorithm", "Enable and configure a `Low Extra Delay Background Transfer`":
as suggested in Section 5.5 of {{?RFC8923}}, these transport features are collectively offered via the `connCapacityProfile` property ({{prop-cap-profile}}). Per-Message control ("Request not to bundle messages") is offered via the `msgCapacityProfile` property ({{send-profile}}).

* Close after reliably delivering all remaining data, causing an event informing the application on the other side:
this is offered by the `Close` action with slightly changed semantics in line with the discussion in Section 5.2 of {{?RFC8923}} ({{termination}}).

* "Abort without delivering remaining data, causing an event informing the application on the other side" and "Abort without delivering remaining data, not causing an event informing the application on the other side":
this is offered by the `Abort` action without promising that this is signaled to the other side. If it is, a `ConnectionError` event will be invoked at the peer ({{termination}}).

* "Reliably transfer data, with congestion control", "Reliably transfer a message, with congestion control" and "Unreliably transfer a message":
data is transferred via the `Send` action ({{sending}}). Reliability is controlled via the `reliability` ({{prop-reliable}}) property and the `msgReliable` Message Property ({{msg-reliable-message}}). Transmitting data as a Message or without delimiters is controlled via Message Framers ({{framing}}). The choice of congestion control is provided via the `congestionControl` property ({{prop-cc}}).

* Configurable Message Reliability:
the `msgLifetime` Message Property implements a time-based way to configure message reliability ({{msg-lifetime}}).

* "Ordered message delivery (potentially slower than unordered)" and "Unordered message delivery (potentially faster than ordered)":
these two transport features are controlled via the Message Property `msgOrdered` ({{msg-ordered}}).

* Request not to delay the acknowledgment (SACK) of a message:
should the protocol support it, this is one of the transport features the Transport Services system can apply when an application uses the `connCapacityProfile` Property ({{prop-cap-profile}}) or the `msgCapacityProfile` Message Property ({{send-profile}}) with value `Low Latency/Interactive`.

* Receive data (with no message delimiting):
`Receive` action ({{receiving}}) and `Received` event ({{receive-complete}}).

* Receive a message:
`Receive` action ({{receiving}}) and `Received` event ({{receive-complete}}), using Message Framers ({{framing}}).

* Information about partial message arrival:
`Receive` action ({{receiving}}) and `ReceivedPartial` event ({{receive-partial}}).

* Notification of send failures:
`Expired` event ({{expired}}) and `SendError` event ({{send-error}}).

* Notification that the stack has no more user data to send:
applications can obtain this information via the `Sent` event ({{sent}}).

* Notification to a receiver that a partial message delivery has been aborted:
`ReceiveError` event ({{receive-error}}).

* Notification of Excessive Retransmissions (early warning below abortion threshold):
 `SoftError` event ({{soft-errors}}).
