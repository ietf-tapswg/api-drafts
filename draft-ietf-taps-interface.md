--- abstract

This document describes an abstract application programming interface (API) to the transport
layer that enables the selection of transport protocols and
network paths dynamically at runtime. This API enables faster deployment
of new protocols and protocol features without requiring changes to the
applications. The specified API follows the Transport Services Architecture
by providing asynchronous, atomic transmission of messages. It is intended to replace the
traditional BSD sockets API as the common interface to the
transport layer, in an environment in which endpoints could select from 
multiple interfaces and potential transport protocols.

# Introduction

This document specifies a modern abstract application programming interface (API) atop the
high-level architecture for Transport Services defined in
{{I-D.ietf-taps-arch}}. The Transport Services Architecture supports
asynchronous, atomic transmission of messages over transport protocols and
network paths dynamically selected at runtime, in environments where an endpoint
selects from multiple interfaces and potential transport protocols.

Applications that adopt this interface will benefit from a wide set of
transport features that can evolve over time. This protocol-independent API ensures that the system
providing the interface can optimize its behavior based on the application
requirements and network conditions, without requiring changes to the
applications.  This flexibility enables faster deployment of new features and
protocols. It can support applications by offering racing and fallback
mechanisms, which otherwise need to be separately implemented in each application.

It derives specific path and protocol selection
properties and supported transport features from the analysis provided in
{{?RFC8095}}, {{?RFC8923}}, and
{{?RFC8922}}. The design encourages implementations 
underneath the interface to dynamically choose a transport protocol depending on an 
application's choices rather than statically binding applications to a protocol at 
compile time. Nevertheless, the Transport Services API also provides
applications with a way to override transport selection and instantiate a specific stack,
e.g., to support servers wishing to listen to a specific protocol. However, forcing a
specific transport stack choice is discouraged for general use, because it can reduce portability.

## Terminology and Notation {#notation}

This API is described in terms of Objects with which an application can interact; 
Actions the application can perform on these Objects; Events, which an
Object can send to an application asynchronously; and Parameters associated
with these Actions and Events.

The following notations, which can be combined, are used in this document:

- An Action creates an Object:

~~~
Object := Action()
~~~

- An Action creates an array of Objects:

~~~
[]Object := Action()
~~~

- An Action is performed on an Object:

~~~
Object.Action()
~~~

- An Object sends an Event:

~~~
Object -> Event<>
~~~

- An Action takes a set of Parameters; an Event contains a set of Parameters.
  Action and Event parameters whose names are suffixed with a question mark are optional.

~~~
Action(param0, param1?, ...) / Event<param0, param1, ...>
~~~

Actions associated with no Object are Actions on the abstract interface
itself; they are equivalent to Actions on a per-application global context.

We also make use of the following basic types:

- Boolean: Instances take the value `true` or `false`.
- Integer: Instances take positive or negative numeric integer values, or sometimes
  special non-numeric (symbolic) values.
- Numeric: Instances take positive or negative numeric values, or sometimes special
  non-numeric (symbolic) values.
- Enumeration: A family of types in which each instance takes one of a fixed,
  predefined set of values specific to a given enumerated type.
- Tuple: An ordered grouping of multiple value types, represented as a
  comma-separated list in parentheses, e.g., (Enumeration, Preference).
  Instances take a sequence of values each valid for the corresponding value
  type, e.g., `(1, true)` for a tuple with type (Integer, Boolean). The composition of types and their order depends on the property and is
  fixed for the property.
- Array: Denoted []Type, an instance takes a value for each of zero or more
  elements in a sequence of the given Type. An array may be of fixed or
  variable length.
- Collection: An unordered grouping of one or more values of the same type.

For guidance on how these abstract concepts may be implemented in languages
in accordance with native design patterns and language and platform features,
see {{implmapping}}.

## Specification of Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Overview of Interface Design {#principles}

The design of the interface specified in this document is based on a set of
principles, themselves an elaboration on the architectural design principles
defined in {{I-D.ietf-taps-arch}}. The interface defined in this document
provides:

- Access to a variety of transport protocols, independent of the
  the Protocol Stacks that will be used at
  runtime, such that all common features of these protocol
  stacks are made available to the application in a
  transport-independent way to the degree possible, enabling applications written to a single API
  to make use of transport protocols in terms of the features they provide;

- A unified interface to datagram and connection-oriented transports, allowing
  use of a common API for connection-establishment and closing;

- Message-orientation, as opposed to stream-orientation, using
  application-assisted framing and deframing where the underlying transport
  does not provide these;

- Asynchronous Connection establishment, transmission, and reception, allowing
  concurrent operations during establishment and supporting event-driven
  application interactions with the transport layer, in line with developments
  in modern platforms and programming languages;

- Explicit support for transport-specific features to be applied should that
  particular transport be part of a chosen Protocol Stack;

- Explicit support for security properties as first-order transport features,
  and for configuration of cryptographic identities and transport security parameters persistent across multiple Connections; and

- Explicit support for multistreaming and multipath transport protocols, and
  the grouping of related Connections into Connection Groups through cloning
  of Connections, to allow applications to take full advantage of new
  transport protocols supporting these features.


# API Summary

The Transport Services API is the basic common abstract application
programming interface to the Transport Services Architecture defined in the Transport Services
Architecture {{I-D.ietf-taps-arch}}.

An application primarily interacts with this API through two Objects:
Preconnections and Connections. A Preconnection represents a set of properties
and constraints on the selection and configuration of paths and protocols to
establish a Connection with an 
Endpoint. A Connection represents an
instance of a
transport Protocol Stack on which data can be sent to and/or received from a
Remote Endpoint (i.e., depending on the kind of transport, connections can be
bi-directional or unidirectional). Connections can be created from
Preconnections in three ways: by initiating the Preconnection (i.e., actively
opening, as in a client), through listening on the Preconnection (i.e.,
passively opening, as in a server), or rendezvousing on the Preconnection (i.e.
peer to peer establishment).

Once a Connection is established, data can be sent and received on it in the form of
Messages. The interface supports the preservation of message boundaries both
via explicit Protocol Stack support, and via application support through a
Message Framer that finds message boundaries in a stream. Messages are
received asynchronously through event handlers registered by the application.
Errors and other notifications also happen asynchronously on the Connection.
It is not necessary for an application to handle all Events; some Events may
have implementation-specific default handlers. The application should not
assume that ignoring Events (e.g., Errors) is always safe.

{{pre-establishment}}, {{establishment}}, {{sending}}, {{receiving}}, and
{{termination}} describe the details of application interaction with Objects
through Actions and Events in each phase of a Connection, following the phases
(Pre-Establishment, Establishment, Data Transfer, and Termination)
described in Section 4.1 of {{I-D.ietf-taps-arch}}.

## Usage Examples

The following usage examples illustrate how an application might use a
Transport Services Interface to:

- Act as a server, by listening for incoming connections, receiving requests,
  and sending responses, see {{server-example}}.
- Act as a client, by connecting to a Remote Endpoint using Initiate, sending
  requests, and receiving responses, see {{client-example}}.
- Act as a peer, by connecting to a Remote Endpoint using Rendezvous while
  simultaneously waiting for incoming Connections, sending Messages, and
  receiving Messages, see {{peer-example}}.

The examples in this section presume that a transport protocol is available
between the Local and Remote Endpoints that provides Reliable Data Transfer, Preservation of
data ordering, and Preservation of Message Boundaries. In this case, the
application can choose to receive only complete messages.

If none of the available transport protocols provides Preservation of Message
Boundaries, but there is a transport protocol that provides a reliable ordered
byte stream, an application could receive this byte stream as partial
Messages and transform it into application-layer Messages.  Alternatively,
an application might provide a Message Framer, which can transform a
sequence of Messages into a byte stream and vice versa ({{framing}}).

### Server Example

This is an example of how an application might listen for incoming Connections
using the Transport Services Interface, and receive a request, and send a response.

~~~
LocalSpecifier := NewLocalEndpoint()
LocalSpecifier.WithInterface("any")
LocalSpecifier.WithService("https")

TransportProperties := NewTransportProperties()
TransportProperties.Require(preserveMsgBoundaries)
// Reliable Data Transfer and Preserve Order are Required by default

SecurityParameters := NewSecurityParameters()
SecurityParameters.Set(identity, myIdentity)
SecurityParameters.Set(key-pair, myPrivateKey, myPublicKey)

// Specifying a Remote Endpoint is optional when using Listen()
Preconnection := NewPreconnection(LocalSpecifier,
                                  TransportProperties,
                                  SecurityParameters)

Listener := Preconnection.Listen()

Listener -> ConnectionReceived<Connection>

// Only receive complete messages in a Conn.Received handler
Connection.Receive()

Connection -> Received<messageDataRequest, messageContext>

//---- Receive event handler begin ----
Connection.Send(messageDataResponse)
Connection.Close()

// Stop listening for incoming Connections
// (this example supports only one Connection)
Listener.Stop()
//---- Receive event handler end ----

~~~


### Client Example

This is an example of how an application might open two Connections to a remote application
using the Transport Services Interface, and send a request as well as receive a response on each of them.

~~~
RemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()
RemoteSpecifier.WithHostname("example.com")
RemoteSpecifier.WithService("https")

TransportProperties := NewTransportProperties()
TransportProperties.Require(preserveMsgBoundaries)
// Reliable Data Transfer and Preserve Order are Required by default

SecurityParameters := NewSecurityParameters()
TrustCallback := NewCallback({
  // Verify identity of the Remote Endpoint, return the result
})
SecurityParameters.SetTrustVerificationCallback(TrustCallback)

// Specifying a local endpoint is optional when using Initiate()
Preconnection := NewPreconnection(RemoteSpecifier,
                                  TransportProperties,
                                  SecurityParameters)

Connection := Preconnection.Initiate()
Connection2 := Connection.Clone()

Connection -> Ready<>
Connection2 -> Ready<>

//---- Ready event handler for any Connection C begin ----
C.Send(messageDataRequest)

// Only receive complete messages
C.Receive()
//---- Ready event handler for any Connection C end ----

Connection -> Received<messageDataResponse, messageContext>
Connection2 -> Received<messageDataResponse, messageContext>

// Close the Connection in a Receive event handler
Connection.Close()
Connection2.Close()
~~~

### Peer Example

This is an example of how an application might establish a connection with a
peer using Rendezvous(), send a Message, and receive a Message.

~~~
// Configure local candidates: a port on the Local Endpoint and via a STUN server
HostCandidate := NewLocalEndpoint()
HostCandidate.WithPort(9876)

StunCandidate := NewLocalEndpoint()
StunCandidate.WithStunServer(address, port, credentials)

LocalCandidates = [HostCandidate, StunCandidate]

// Configure transport and security properties
TransportProperties := ...
SecurityParameters  := ...

Preconnection := NewPreconnection(LocalCandidates,
                                  [], // No remote candidates yet
                                  TransportProperties,
                                  SecurityParameters)

// Resolve the LocalCandidates. The Preconnection.Resolve() call 
// resolves both local and remote candidates but, since the remote
// candidates have not yet been specified, the ResolvedRemote list
// returned will be empty and is not used.
ResolvedLocal, ResolvedRemote = Preconnection.Resolve()

// ...Send the ResolvedLocal list to peer via signalling channel
// ...Receive a list of RemoteCandidates from peer via signalling channel

Preconnection.AddRemote(RemoteCandidates)
Preconnection.Rendezvous()

Preconnection -> RendezvousDone<Connection>

//---- Ready event handler begin ----
Connection.Send(messageDataRequest)
Connection.Receive()
//---- Ready event handler end ----

Connection -> Received<messageDataResponse, messageContext>

// Close the Connection in a Receive event handler
Connection.Close()
~~~

## Transport Properties {#transport-properties}

Each application using the Transport Services Interface declares its preferences
for how the transport service should operate using properties at each stage of
the lifetime of a connection using Transport Properties, as defined in
{{I-D.ietf-taps-arch}}. 

Transport Properties are divided into Selection, Connection, and Message
Properties. Selection Properties (see {{selection-props}}) can only be set during pre-establishment. They are only used to specify which paths and protocol stacks can be used and are preferred by the application. 
Although Connection Properties (see {{connection-props}}) can be set during pre-establishment, they may be changed later. They are used to inform decisions made during establishment and to fine-tune the established connection.  
The behavior of the selected protocol stack(s) when
sending Messages is controlled by Message Properties (see {{message-props}}).

All Transport Properties, regardless of the phase in which they are used, are
organized within a single namespace. This enables setting them as defaults at
earlier stages and querying them in later stages:

- Connection Properties can be set on Preconnections and Connections
- Message Properties can be set on Preconnections, Connections and Messages
- The effect of Selection Properties can be queried on Connections and Messages

Note that configuring Connection Properties and Message Properties on
Preconnections is preferred over setting them later. Early specification of
Connection Properties allows their use as additional input to the selection
process. Protocol Specific Properties, which enable configuration of specialized
features of a specific protocol, see Section 3.2 of {{I-D.ietf-taps-arch}}, are not
used as an input to the selection process but only support configuration if
the respective protocol has been selected.


### Transport Property Names {#property-names}

Transport Properties are referred to by property names. For the purposes of this document, these names are
alphanumeric strings in which words may be separated by hyphens.
These names serve two purposes:

- Allowing different components of a Transport Services implementation to pass Transport
  Properties, e.g., between a language frontend and a policy manager,
  or as a representation of properties retrieved from a file or other storage.
- Making the code of different Transport Services implementations look similar. While individual programming languages may preclude strict adherence to the aforementioned naming convention (for instance, by prohibiting the use of hyphens in symbols), users interacting with multiple implementations will still benefit from the consistency resulting from the use of visually similar symbols.

Transport Property Names are hierarchically organized in the
form \[\<Namespace>.\]\<PropertyName\>.

- The Namespace component MUST be empty for well-known, generic properties, i.e., for
  properties that are not specific to a protocol and are defined in an RFC.
- Protocol Specific Properties MUST use the protocol acronym as the Namespace, e.g.,
  `tcp` for TCP specific Transport Properties. For IETF protocols, property
  names under these namespaces SHOULD be defined in an RFC.
- Vendor or implementation specific properties MUST use a string identifying
  the vendor or implementation as the Namespace.
  
Namespaces for each of the keywords provided in the IANA protocol numbers registry 
(see https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml), reformatted where necessary to conform to an implementation's naming conventions, are reserved
for Protocol Specific Properties and MUST NOT be used for vendor or implementation-specific properties. 

### Transport Property Types {#property-types}

Transport Properties each have a type, which can be:

- One of the basic types described in {{notation}}; or
- Preference, which is an Enumeration with five possible
  values: Prohibit, Avoid, Ignore, Prefer, or Require. Each of these
  denotes a level of preference of a given property during protocol
  selection.
  (See also {{selection-props}}.) The Preference type is used only on Preconnections, and only for Selection Properties.

## Scope of the Interface Definition {#scope-of-interface-defn}

This document defines a language- and platform-independent interface to a
Transport Services system. Given the wide variety of languages and language
conventions used to write applications that use the transport layer to connect
to other applications over the Internet, this independence makes this interface
necessarily abstract. 

There is no interoperability benefit in tightly defining how the interface is
presented to application programmers across diverse platforms. However,
maintaining the "shape" of the abstract interface across different platforms reduces
the effort for programmers who learn the Transport Services interface to then
apply their knowledge to another platform.

We therefore make the following recommendations:

- Actions, Events, and Errors in implementations of this interface SHOULD use
  the names given for them in the document, subject to capitalization,
  punctuation, and other typographic conventions in the language of the
  implementation, unless the implementation itself uses different names for
  substantially equivalent objects for networking by convention.
- Implementations of this interface SHOULD implement each Selection Property,
  Connection Property, and Message Context Property specified in this document. Each interface SHOULD be implemented even when in a specific implementation/platform it
  will always result in no operation, e.g. there is no action when the API
  specifies a Property that is not available in a transport protocol implemented
  on a specific platform. For example, if TCP is the only underlying transport protocol, the Message Property `msgOrdered` can be implemented (trivially, as a no-op) as disabling the requirement for ordering will not have any effect on delivery order for Connections over TCP. Similarly, the `msgLifetime` Message Property can be implemented but ignored, as the description of this Property states that "it is not guaranteed that a Message will not be sent when its Lifetime has expired".
- Implementations may use other representations for Transport Property Names,
  e.g., by providing constants, but should provide a straight-forward mapping
  between their representation and the property names specified here.

# Pre-Establishment Phase {#pre-establishment}

The Pre-Establishment phase allows applications to specify properties for
the Connections that they are about to make, or to query the API about potential
Connections they could make.

A Preconnection Object represents a potential Connection. It has state that
describes the properties of a Connection that might exist in the future.  This state
comprises Local Endpoint and Remote Endpoint Objects that denote the endpoints
of the potential Connection (see {{endpointspec}}), the Selection Properties
(see {{selection-props}}), any preconfigured Connection Properties
({{connection-props}}), and the security parameters (see
{{security-parameters}}):

~~~
   Preconnection := NewPreconnection([]LocalEndpoint,
                                     []RemoteEndpoint,
                                     TransportProperties,
                                     SecurityParameters)
~~~

At least one Local Endpoint MUST be specified if the Preconnection is used to Listen()
for incoming Connections, but the list of Local Endpoints MAY be empty if
the Preconnection is used to Initiate()
connections. If no Local Endpoint is specified, the Transport Services system will
assign an ephemeral local port to the Connection on the appropriate interface(s).
At least one Remote Endpoint MUST be specified if the Preconnection is used
to Initiate() Connections, but the list of Remote Endpoints MAY be empty if 
the Preconnection is used to Listen() for incoming Connections.
At least one Local Endpoint and one Remote Endpoint MUST be specified if a
peer-to-peer Rendezvous is to occur based on the Preconnection.

If more than one Local Endpoint is specified on a Preconnection, then all
the Local Endpoints on the Preconnection MUST represent the same host. For
example, they might correspond to different interfaces on a multi-homed
host, of they might correspond to local interfaces and a STUN server that
can be resolved to a server reflexive address for a Preconnection used to
make a peer-to-peer Rendezvous().

If more than one Remote Endpoint is specified on the Preconnection, then
all the Remote Endpoints on the Preconnection SHOULD represent the same
host. For example, the Remote Endpoints might represent various network
interfaces of a host, or a server reflexive address that can be used to
reach a host, or a set of hosts that provide equivalent local balanced
service. 

In most cases, it is expected that a single Remote Endpoint will be
specified by name, and a later call to  Initiate() on the Preconnection
(see {{initiate}}) will internally resolve that name to a list of concrete
endpoints. Specifying multiple Remote Endpoints on a Preconnection allows
applications to override this for more detailed control.

If Message Framers are used (see {{framing}}), they MUST be added to the
Preconnection during pre-establishment.

## Specifying Endpoints {#endpointspec}

The Transport Services API uses the Local Endpoint and Remote Endpoint Objects
to refer to the endpoints of a transport connection. Endpoints can be created
as either Remote or Local:

~~~
RemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()
LocalSpecifier := NewLocalEndpoint()
~~~

A single Endpoint Object represents the identity of a network host. That endpoint
can be more or less specific depending on which identifiers are set. For example,
an Endpoint that only specifies a hostname may in fact end up corresponding
to several different IP addresses on different hosts.

An Endpoint Object can be configured with the following identifiers:

- Hostname (string)

~~~
RemoteSpecifier.WithHostname("example.com")
~~~

- Port (a 16-bit integer) or a Service (string) that maps to a port

~~~
RemoteSpecifier.WithPort(443)
~~~

~~~
RemoteSpecifier.WithService("https")
~~~

- IP address (IPv4 or IPv6 address)

~~~
RemoteSpecifier.WithIPv4Address(192.0.2.21)
~~~

~~~
RemoteSpecifier.WithIPv6Address(2001:db8:4920:e29d:a420:7461:7073:0a)
~~~

- Interface (string name)

~~~
LocalSpecifier.WithInterface("en0")
~~~

An Endpoint cannot have multiple identifiers of a same type set. That is,
an endpoint cannot have two IP addresses specified. Two separate IP addresses
are represented as two Endpoint Objects. If a Preconnection specifies a Remote
Endpoint with a specific IP address set, it will only establish Connections to
that IP address. If, on the other hand, the Remote Endpoint specifies a hostname
but no addresses, the Connection can perform name resolution and attempt
using any address derived from the original hostname of the Remote Endpoint.

The Transport Services API resolves names internally, when the Initiate(),
Listen(), or Rendezvous() method is called to establish a Connection. Privacy
considerations for the timing of this resolution are given in {{privacy-security}}.

The Resolve() action on a Preconnection can be used by the application to force
early binding when required, for example with some Network Address Translator
(NAT) traversal protocols (see {{rendezvous}}).

### Using Multicast Endpoints

Specifying a multicast group address on a Local Endpoint will indicate to the transport
system that the resulting connection will be used to receive multicast messages. The
Remote Endpoint can be used to filter incoming multicast from specific senders. Such
a Preconnection will only support calling Listen(), not Initiate(). The accepted Connections
are receive-only.

Similarly, specifying a multicast group address on the Remote Endpoint will indicate that the
resulting connection will be used to send multicast messages.

### Endpoint Aliases

An Endpoint can have an alternative definition when using different protocols.
For example, a server that supports both TLS/TCP and QUIC may be accessible
on two different port numbers depending on which protocol is used.

To support this, Endpoint Objects can specify "aliases". An Endpoint can have
multiple aliases set.

~~~
RemoteSpecifier.AddAlias(AlternateRemoteSpecifier)
~~~

In order to scope an alias to a specific transport protocol, an Endpoint can
specify a protocol identifier. These identifiers MUST only be set for aliases.

~~~
RemoteSpecifier.WithProtocol(QUIC)
~~~

The following example shows a case where "example.com" has a server
running on port 443, with an alternate port of 8443 for QUIC.

~~~
RemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()
RemoteSpecifier.WithHostname("example.com")
RemoteSpecifier.WithPort(443)

QUICRemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()
QUICRemoteSpecifier.WithHostname("example.com")
QUICRemoteSpecifier.WithPort(8443)
QUICRemoteSpecifier.WithProtocol(QUIC)

RemoteSpecifier.AddAlias(QUICRemoteSpecifier)
~~~

### Endpoint Examples

The following examples of Endpoints show common usage patterns.

Specify a Remote Endpoint using a hostname and service name:

~~~
RemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()
RemoteSpecifier.WithHostname("example.com")
RemoteSpecifier.WithService("https")
~~~

Specify a Remote Endpoint using an IPv6 address and remote port:

~~~
RemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()
RemoteSpecifier.WithIPv6Address(2001:db8:4920:e29d:a420:7461:7073:0a)
RemoteSpecifier.WithPort(443)
~~~

Specify a Remote Endpoint using an IPv4 address and remote port:

~~~
RemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()
RemoteSpecifier.WithIPv4Address(192.0.2.21)
RemoteSpecifier.WithPort(443)
~~~

Specify a Local Endpoint using a local interface name and local port:

~~~
LocalSpecifier := NewLocalEndpoint()
LocalSpecifier.WithInterface("en0")
LocalSpecifier.WithPort(443)
~~~

As an alternative to specifying an interface name for the Local Endpoint, an application
can express more fine-grained preferences using the `Interface Instance or Type`
Selection Property, see {{prop-interface}}. However, if the application specifies Selection
Properties that are inconsistent with the Local Endpoint, this will result in an Error once the
application attempts to open a Connection.

Specify a Local Endpoint using a STUN server:

~~~
LocalSpecifier := NewLocalEndpoint()
LocalSpecifier.WithStunServer(address, port, credentials)
~~~

Specify a Local Endpoint using an Any-Source Multicast group to join on a named local interface:

~~~
LocalSpecifier := NewLocalEndpoint()
LocalSpecifier.WithIPv4Address(233.252.0.0)
LocalSpecifier.WithInterface("en0")
~~~

Source-Specific Multicast requires setting both a Local and Remote Endpoint:

~~~
LocalSpecifier := NewLocalEndpoint()
LocalSpecifier.WithIPv4Address(232.1.1.1)
LocalSpecifier.WithInterface("en0")

RemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()
RemoteSpecifier.WithIPv4Address(192.0.2.22)
~~~

## Specifying Transport Properties {#selection-props}

A Preconnection Object holds properties reflecting the application's
requirements and preferences for the transport. These include Selection
Properties for selecting protocol stacks and paths, as well as Connection
Properties for configuration of the detailed operation of the selected Protocol
Stacks.

The protocol(s) and path(s) selected as candidates during establishment are
determined and configured using these properties. Since there could be paths
over which some transport protocols are unable to operate, or remote endpoints
that support only specific network addresses or transports, transport protocol
selection is necessarily tied to path selection. This may involve choosing
between multiple local interfaces that are connected to different access
networks.

Most Selection Properties are represented as Preferences, which can
take one of five values:

   | Preference | Effect                                                                 |
   |------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Require    | Select only protocols/paths providing the property, fail otherwise     |
   | Prefer     | Prefer protocols/paths providing the property, proceed otherwise       |
   | Ignore     | No preference                                                          |
   | Avoid      | Prefer protocols/paths not providing the property, proceed otherwise   |
   | Prohibit   | Select only protocols/paths not providing the property, fail otherwise |
{: #tab-pref-levels title="Selection Property Preference Levels"}

The implementation MUST ensure an outcome that is consistent with all application
requirements expressed using Require and Prohibit. While preferences
expressed using Prefer and Avoid influence protocol and path selection as well,
outcomes can vary given the same Selection Properties, because the available
protocols and paths can differ across systems and contexts. However,
implementations are RECOMMENDED to seek to provide a consistent outcome
to an application, given the same set of Selection Properties.

Note that application preferences can conflict with each other. For
example, if an application indicates a preference for a specific path by
specifying an interface, but also a preference for a protocol, a situation
might occur in which the preferred protocol is not available on the preferred
path. In such cases, applications can expect properties that determine path
selection to be prioritized over properties that determine protocol selection.
The transport system SHOULD determine the preferred path first, regardless of
protocol preferences. This ordering is chosen to provide consistency across
implementations, based on the fact that it is more common for the use of a
given network path to determine cost to the user (i.e., an interface type
preference might be based on a user's preference to avoid being charged
more for a cellular data plan).

Selection and Connection Properties, as well as defaults for Message
Properties, can be added to a Preconnection to configure the selection process
and to further configure the eventually selected protocol stack(s). They are
collected into a TransportProperties object to be passed into a Preconnection
object:

~~~
TransportProperties := NewTransportProperties()
~~~

Individual properties are then set on the TransportProperties Object.
Setting a Transport Property to a value overrides the previous value of this Transport Property.

~~~
TransportProperties.Set(property, value)
~~~

To aid readability, implementations MAY provide additional convenience functions to simplify use of Selection Properties: see {{preference-conv}} for examples.
In addition, implementations MAY provide a mechanism to create TransportProperties objects that are preconfigured for common use cases as outlined in {{property-profiles}}.

Transport Properties for an established connection can be queried via the Connection object, as outlined in {{introspection}}.

A Connection gets its Transport Properties either by being explicitly configured
via a Preconnection, by configuration after establishment, or by inheriting them
from an antecedent via cloning; see {{groups}} for more.

{{connection-props}} provides a list of Connection Properties, while Selection
Properties are listed in the subsections below. Many properties are
only considered during establishment, and can not be changed after a Connection
is established; however, they can still be queried. The return type of a queried
Selection Property is Boolean, where `true` means that the Selection Property
has been applied and `false` means that the Selection Property has not
been applied. Note that `true` does not mean that a request has been honored.
For example, if `Congestion control` was
requested with preference level `Prefer`, but congestion control could not
be supported, querying the `congestionControl` property yields the
value `false`. If the preference level `Avoid` was used for `Congestion control`,
and, as requested, the Connection is not congestion controlled, querying
the `congestionControl` property also yields the value `false`.

An implementation of this interface must provide sensible defaults for Selection
Properties. The recommended default values for each property below represent a
configuration that can be implemented over TCP. If these default values are used
and TCP is not supported by a Transport Services implementation, then an application using the
default set of Properties might not succeed in establishing a connection. Using
the same default values for independent Transport Services implementations can be beneficial
when applications are ported between different implementations/platforms, even if this
default could lead to a connection failure when TCP is not available. If default
values other than those recommended below are used, it is recommended to clearly document any differences.


### Reliable Data Transfer (Connection) {#prop-reliable}

Name:
: reliability

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: Require

This property specifies whether the application needs to use a transport
protocol that ensures that all data is received at the Remote Endpoint without
corruption. When reliable data transfer is enabled, this
also entails being notified when a Connection is closed or aborted.

### Preservation of Message Boundaries {#prop-boundaries}

Name:
: preserveMsgBoundaries

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: Ignore

This property specifies whether the application needs or prefers to use a transport
protocol that preserves message boundaries.

### Configure Per-Message Reliability {#prop-partially-reliable}

Name:
: perMsgReliability

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: Ignore

This property specifies whether an application considers it useful to indicate
its reliability requirements on a per-Message basis. This property applies to
Connections and Connection Groups.

### Preservation of Data Ordering {#prop-ordering}

Name:
: preserveOrder

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: Require

This property specifies whether the application wishes to use a transport
protocol that can ensure that data is received by the application on the other
end in the same order as it was sent.

### Use 0-RTT Session Establishment with a Safely Replayable Message {#prop-0rtt}

Name:
: zeroRttMsg

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: Ignore

This property specifies whether an application would like to supply a Message to
the transport protocol before Connection establishment that will then be
reliably transferred to the other side before or during Connection
establishment. This Message can potentially be received multiple times (i.e., 
multiple copies of the message data may be passed to the Remote Endpoint). 
See also {{msg-safelyreplayable}}.

### Multistream Connections in Group {#prop-multistream}

Name:
: multistreaming

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: Prefer

This property specifies that the application would prefer multiple Connections
within a Connection Group to be provided by streams of a single underlying
transport connection where possible.

### Full Checksum Coverage on Sending {#prop-checksum-control-send}

Name:
: perMsgChecksumSend

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: Require

This property specifies the application's need for protection against
corruption for all data transmitted on this Connection. Disabling this property could enable
later control of the sender checksum coverage (see {{msg-checksum}}).

### Full Checksum Coverage on Receiving {#prop-checksum-control-receive}

Name:
: perMsgChecksumRecv

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: Require

This property specifies the application's need for protection against
corruption for all data received on this Connection. Disabling this property could enable
later control of the required minimum receiver checksum coverage (see {{conn-recv-checksum}}).

### Congestion Control {#prop-cc}

Name:
: congestionControl

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: Require

This property specifies whether the application would like the Connection to be
congestion controlled or not. Note that if a Connection is not congestion
controlled, an application using such a Connection SHOULD itself perform
congestion control in accordance with {{!RFC2914}} or use a circuit breaker in
accordance with {{!RFC8084}}, whichever is appropriate. Also note that reliability
is usually combined with congestion control in protocol implementations,
rendering "reliable but not congestion controlled" a request that is unlikely to
succeed. If the Connection is congestion controlled, performing additional congestion control
in the application can have negative performance implications.

### Keep Alive {#keepAlive}

Name:
: keepAlive

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: Ignore

This property specifies whether the application would like the Connection to send
keep-alive packets or not. Note that if a Connection determines that keep-alive
packets are being sent, the applicaton should itself avoid generating additional keep alive
messages. Note that when supported, the system will use the default period
for generation of the keep alive-packets. (See also {{keepAliveTimeout}}).

### Interface Instance or Type {#prop-interface}

Name:
: interface

Type:
: Collection of (Preference, Enumeration)

Default:
: Empty (not setting a preference for any interface)

This property allows the application to select any specific network interfaces
or categories of interfaces it wants to `Require`, `Prohibit`, `Prefer`, or
`Avoid`. Note that marking a specific interface as `Require` strictly limits path
selection to that single interface, and often leads to less flexible and resilient
connection establishment.

In contrast to other Selection Properties, this property is a tuple of an
(Enumerated) interface identifier and a preference, and can either be
implemented directly as such, or for making one preference available for each
interface and interface type available on the system.

The set of valid interface types is implementation- and system-specific. For
example, on a mobile device, there may be `Wi-Fi` and `Cellular` interface types
available; whereas on a desktop computer,  `Wi-Fi` and `Wired
Ethernet` interface types might be available. An implementation should provide all types
that are supported on the local system to all remote systems, to allow
applications to be written generically. For example, if a single implementation
is used on both mobile devices and desktop devices, it should define the
`Cellular` interface type for both systems, since an application might wish to
always prohibit cellular.

The set of interface types is expected to change over time as new access
technologies become available. The taxonomy of interface types on a given
Transport Services system is implementation-specific.

Interface types should not be treated as a proxy for properties of interfaces
such as metered or unmetered network access. If an application needs to prohibit
metered interfaces, this should be specified via Provisioning Domain attributes
(see {{prop-pvd}}) or another specific property.

### Provisioning Domain Instance or Type {#prop-pvd}

Name:
: pvd

Type:
: Collection of (Preference, Enumeration)

Default:
: Empty (not setting a preference for any PvD)

Similar to interface instances and types (see {{prop-interface}}), this property
allows the application to control path selection by selecting which specific
Provisioning Domain (PvD) or categories of PVDs it wants to
`Require`, `Prohibit`, `Prefer`, or `Avoid`. Provisioning Domains define
consistent sets of network properties that may be more specific than network
interfaces {{RFC7556}}.

As with interface instances and types, this property is a tuple of an (Enumerated)
PvD identifier and a preference, and can either be implemented directly as such,
or for making one preference available for each interface and interface type
available on the system.

The identification of a specific PvD is
implementation- and system-specific, because there is currently no portable standard
format for a PvD identifier. For example, this identifier might be a string name
or an integer. As with requiring specific interfaces, requiring a specific PvD
strictly limits the path selection.

Categories or types of PvDs are also defined to be implementation- and
system-specific. These can be useful to identify a service that is provided by a
PvD. For example, if an application wants to use a PvD that provides a
Voice-Over-IP service on a Cellular network, it can use the relevant PvD type to
require a PvD that provides this service, without needing to look up a
particular instance. While this does restrict path selection, it is broader than
requiring specific PvD instances or interface instances, and should be preferred
over these options.

### Use Temporary Local Address

Name:
: useTemporaryLocalAddress

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: Avoid for Listeners and Rendezvous Connections. Prefer for other Connections.

This property allows the application to express a preference for the use of
temporary local addresses, sometimes called "privacy" addresses {{!RFC4941}}.
Temporary addresses are generally used to prevent linking connections over time
when a stable address, sometimes called "permanent" address, is not needed.
There are some caveats to note when specifying this property. First, if an
application Requires the use of temporary addresses, the resulting Connection
cannot use IPv4, because temporary addresses do not exist in IPv4. Second,
temporary local addresses might involve trading off privacy for performance.
For instance, temporary addresses can interfere with resumption mechanisms
that some protocols rely on to reduce initial latency.

### Multipath Transport {#multipath-mode}

Name:
: multipath

Type:
: Enumeration

Default:
: Disabled for connections created through initiate and rendezvous, Passive for listeners

This property specifies whether and how applications want to take advantage of
transferring data across multiple paths between the same end hosts.
Using multiple paths allows connections to migrate between interfaces or aggregate bandwidth
as availability and performance properties change.
Possible values are:

Disabled:
: The connection will not use multiple paths once established, even if the chosen transport supports using multiple paths.

Active:
: The connection will negotiate the use of multiple paths if the chosen transport supports this. 

Passive:
: The connection will support the use of multiple paths if the Remote Endpoint requests it. 

The policy for using multiple paths is specified using the separate multipathPolicy property, see {{multipathPolicy}} below.
To enable the peer endpoint to initiate additional paths towards a local address other than the one initially used, it is necessary to set the Alternative Addresses property (see {{altaddr}} below).

Setting this property to "Active", can have privacy implications: It enables the transport to establish connectivity using alternate paths that might result in users being linkable across the multiple paths, even if the Advertisement of Alternative Addresses property (see {{altaddr}} below) is set to false.

Enumeration values other than "Disabled" are interpreted as a preference for choosing protocols that can make use of multiple paths.
The "Disabled" value implies a requirement not to use multiple paths in parallel but does not prevent choosing a protocol that is capable of using multiple paths, e.g., it does not prevent choosing TCP, but prevents sending the `MP_CAPABLE` option in the TCP handshake.

### Advertisement of Alternative Addresses {#altaddr}

Name:
: advertisesAltaddr

Type:
: Boolean

Default:
: False

This property specifies whether alternative addresses, e.g., of other interfaces, should be advertised to the
peer endpoint by the protocol stack. Advertising these addresses enables the peer-endpoint to establish additional connectivity, e.g., for connection migration or using multiple paths.

Note that this can have privacy implications because it might result in users being linkable across the multiple paths.
Also, note that setting this to false does not prevent the local Transport Services system from _establishing_ connectivity using alternate paths (see {{multipath-mode}} above); it only prevents _proactive advertisement_ of addresses.

### Direction of communication

Name:
: direction

Type:
: Enumeration

Default:
: Bidirectional

This property specifies whether an application wants to use the connection for sending and/or receiving data.  Possible values are:

Bidirectional:
: The connection must support sending and receiving data

Unidirectional send:
: The connection must support sending data, and the application cannot use the connection to receive any data

Unidirectional receive:
: The connection must support receiving data, and the application cannot use the connection to send any data

Since unidirectional communication can be
supported by transports offering bidirectional communication, specifying
unidirectional communication may cause a transport stack that supports
bidirectional communication to be selected.


### Notification of ICMP soft error message arrival {#prop-soft-error}

Name:
: softErrorNotify

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: Ignore

This property specifies whether an application considers it useful to be
informed when an ICMP error message arrives that does not force termination of a
connection. When set to true, received ICMP errors are available as
SoftErrors, see {{soft-errors}}. Note that even if a protocol supporting this property is selected,
not all ICMP errors will necessarily be delivered, so applications cannot rely
upon receiving them {{!RFC8085}}.


### Initiating side is not the first to write {#activeReadBeforeSend}

Name:
: activeReadBeforeSend

Type:
: Preference

Default:
: Ignore

The most common client-server communication pattern involves the
client actively opening a connection, then sending data to the server. The
server listens (passive open), reads, and then answers. This property
specifies whether an application wants to diverge from this pattern -- either
by actively opening with Initiate(), immediately followed by reading, or passively opening with Listen(),
immediately followed by writing. This property is ignored when establishing
connections using Rendezvous().
Requiring this property limits the choice of mappings to underlying protocols,
which can reduce
efficiency. For example, it prevents the Transport Services system from mapping
Connections to SCTP streams, where
the first transmitted data takes the role of an active open signal {{I-D.ietf-taps-impl}}.


## Specifying Security Parameters and Callbacks {#security-parameters}

Most security parameters, e.g., TLS ciphersuites, local identity and private key, etc.,
may be configured statically. Others are dynamically configured during connection establishment.
Security parameters and callbacks are partitioned based on their place in the lifetime
of connection establishment. Similar to Transport Properties, both parameters and callbacks
are inherited during cloning (see {{groups}}).

### Pre-Connection Parameters

Common parameters such as TLS ciphersuites are known to implementations. Clients should
use common safe defaults for these values whenever possible. However, as discussed in
{{?RFC8922}}, many transport security protocols require specific
security parameters and constraints from the client at the time of configuration and
actively during a handshake. These configuration parameters need to be specified in the
pre-connection phase and are created as follows:

~~~
SecurityParameters := NewSecurityParameters()
~~~

Security configuration parameters and sample usage follow:

- Local identity and private keys: Used to perform private key operations and prove one's
identity to the Remote Endpoint. (Note, if private keys are not available, e.g., since they are
stored in hardware security modules (HSMs), handshake callbacks must be used. See below for details.)

~~~
SecurityParameters.Set(identity, myIdentity)
SecurityParameters.Set(key-pair, myPrivateKey, myPublicKey)
~~~

- Supported algorithms: Used to restrict what parameters are used by underlying transport security protocols.
When not specified, these algorithms should use known and safe defaults for the system. Parameters include:
ciphersuites, supported groups, and signature algorithms. These parameters take a collection of supported algorithms as parameter.

~~~
SecurityParameters.Set(supported-group, "secp256k1")
SecurityParameters.Set(ciphersuite, "TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256")
SecurityParameters.Set(signature-algorithm, "ed25519")
~~~

- Pre-Shared Key import: Used to install pre-shared keying material established
out-of-band. Each pre-shared keying material is associated with some identity that typically identifies
its use or has some protocol-specific meaning to the Remote Endpoint.

~~~
SecurityParameters.Set(pre-shared-key, key, identity)
~~~

- Session cache management: Used to tune session cache capacity, lifetime, and
other policies.

~~~
SecurityParameters.Set(max-cached-sessions, 16)
SecurityParameters.Set(cached-session-lifetime-seconds, 3600)
~~~

Connections that use Transport Services SHOULD use security in general. However, for
compatibility with endpoints that do not support transport security protocols (such
as a TCP endpoint that does not support TLS), applications can initialize their
security parameters to indicate that security can be disabled, or can be opportunistic.
If security is disabled, the Transport Services system will not attempt to add
transport security automatically. If security is opportunistic, it will allow
Connections without transport security, but will still attempt to use security if
available.

~~~
SecurityParameters := NewDisabledSecurityParameters()

SecurityParameters := NewOpportunisticSecurityParameters()
~~~

Representation of Security Parameters in implementations should parallel that chosen for Transport Property names as recommended in {{scope-of-interface-defn}}.

### Connection Establishment Callbacks

Security decisions, especially pertaining to trust, are not static. Once configured,
parameters may also be supplied during connection establishment. These are best
handled as client-provided callbacks. Security handshake callbacks that may be
invoked during connection establishment include:

- Trust verification callback: Invoked when a Remote Endpoint's trust must be validated before the
handshake protocol can continue.

~~~
TrustCallback := NewCallback({
  // Handle trust, return the result
})
SecurityParameters.SetTrustVerificationCallback(trustCallback)
~~~

- Identity challenge callback: Invoked when a private key operation is required, e.g., when
local authentication is requested by a Remote Endpoint.

~~~
ChallengeCallback := NewCallback({
  // Handle challenge
})
SecurityParameters.SetIdentityChallengeCallback(challengeCallback)
~~~

# Establishing Connections {#establishment}

Before a Connection can be used for data transfer, it needs to be established.
Establishment ends the pre-establishment phase; all transport properties and
cryptographic parameter specification must be complete before establishment,
as these will be used to select candidate Paths and Protocol Stacks
for the Connection. Establishment may be active, using the Initiate() Action;
passive, using the Listen() Action; or simultaneous for peer-to-peer, using
the Rendezvous() Action. These Actions are described in the subsections below.


## Active Open: Initiate {#initiate}

Active open is the Action of establishing a Connection to a Remote Endpoint presumed
to be listening for incoming Connection requests. Active open is used by clients in
client-server interactions. Active open is supported by this interface through the
Initiate Action:

~~~
Connection := Preconnection.Initiate(timeout?)
~~~

The timeout parameter specifies how long to wait before aborting Active open.
Before calling Initiate, the caller must have populated a Preconnection
Object with a Remote Endpoint specifier, optionally a Local Endpoint
specifier (if not specified, the system will attempt to determine a
suitable Local Endpoint), as well as all properties
necessary for candidate selection.

The Initiate() Action returns a Connection object. Once Initiate() has been
called, any changes to the Preconnection MUST NOT have any effect on the
Connection. However, the Preconnection can be reused, e.g., to Initiate
another Connection.

Once Initiate is called, the candidate Protocol Stack(s) may cause one or more
candidate transport-layer connections to be created to the specified Remote 
Endpoint. The caller may immediately begin sending Messages on the Connection
(see {{sending}}) after calling Initiate(); note that any data marked `Safely Replayable` that is sent
while the Connection is being established may be sent multiple times or on
multiple candidates.

The following Events may be sent by the Connection after Initiate() is called:

~~~
Connection -> Ready<>
~~~

The Ready Event occurs after Initiate has established a transport-layer
connection on at least one usable candidate Protocol Stack over at least one
candidate Path. No Receive Events (see {{receiving}}) will occur before
the Ready Event for Connections established using Initiate.

~~~
Connection -> EstablishmentError<reason?>
~~~

An EstablishmentError occurs either when the set of transport properties and security
parameters cannot be fulfilled on a Connection for initiation (e.g., the set of
available Paths and/or Protocol Stacks meeting the constraints is empty) or
reconciled with the Local and/or Remote Endpoints; when the remote specifier
cannot be resolved; or when no transport-layer connection can be established to
the Remote Endpoint (e.g., because the Remote Endpoint is not accepting
connections, the application is prohibited from opening a Connection by the
operating system, or the establishment attempt has timed out for any other reason).

Connection establishment
and transmission of the first message can be combined in a single action {{initiate-and-send}}.

## Passive Open: Listen {#listen}

Passive open is the Action of waiting for Connections from Remote Endpoints,
commonly used by servers in client-server interactions. Passive open is
supported by this interface through the Listen Action and returns a Listener object:

~~~
Listener := Preconnection.Listen()
~~~

Before calling Listen, the caller must have initialized the Preconnection
during the pre-establishment phase with a Local Endpoint specifier, as well
as all properties necessary for Protocol Stack selection. A Remote Endpoint
may optionally be specified, to constrain what Connections are accepted.

The Listen() Action returns a Listener object. Once Listen() has been called,
any changes to the Preconnection MUST NOT have any effect on the Listener. The
Preconnection can be disposed of or reused, e.g., to create another Listener.

~~~
Listener.Stop()
~~~

Listening continues until the global context shuts down, or until the Stop
action is performed on the Listener object.

~~~
Listener -> ConnectionReceived<Connection>
~~~

The ConnectionReceived Event occurs when a Remote Endpoint has established a
transport-layer connection to this Listener (for Connection-oriented
transport protocols), or when the first Message has been received from the
Remote Endpoint (for Connectionless protocols), causing a new Connection to be
created. The resulting Connection is contained within the ConnectionReceived
Event, and is ready to use as soon as it is passed to the application via the
event.

~~~
Listener.SetNewConnectionLimit(value)
~~~

If the caller wants to rate-limit the number of inbound Connections that will be delivered,
it can set a cap using SetNewConnectionLimit(). This mechanism allows a server to
protect itself from being drained of resources. Each time a new Connection is delivered
by the ConnectionReceived Event, the value is automatically decremented. Once the
value reaches zero, no further Connections will be delivered until the caller sets the
limit to a higher value. By default, this value is Infinite. The caller is also able to reset
the value to Infinite at any point.

~~~
Listener -> EstablishmentError<reason?>
~~~

An EstablishmentError occurs either when the Properties and Security Parameters of the Preconnection cannot be fulfilled for listening or cannot be reconciled with the Local Endpoint (and/or Remote Endpoint, if specified), when the Local Endpoint (or Remote Endpoint, if specified) cannot
be resolved, or when the application is prohibited from listening by policy.

~~~
Listener -> Stopped<>
~~~

A Stopped Event occurs after the Listener has stopped listening.

## Peer-to-Peer Establishment: Rendezvous {#rendezvous}

Simultaneous peer-to-peer Connection establishment is supported by the
Rendezvous() Action:

~~~
Preconnection.Rendezvous()
~~~

A Preconnection Object used in a Rendezvous() MUST have both the
Local Endpoint candidates and the Remote Endpoint candidates specified,
along with the transport properties and security parameters needed for
Protocol Stack selection, before the Rendezvous() Action is initiated.

The Rendezvous() Action listens on the Local Endpoint
candidates for an incoming Connection from the Remote Endpoint candidates,
while also simultaneously trying to establish a Connection from the Local
Endpoint candidates to the Remote Endpoint candidates.

If there are multiple Local Endpoints or Remote Endpoints configured, then
initiating a Rendezvous() action will systematically probe the reachability
of those endpoint candidates following an approach such as that used in
Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) {{?RFC5245}}.

If the endpoints are suspected to be behind a NAT, Rendezvous() can be
initiated using Local Endpoints that support a method of discovering NAT
bindings such as Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) {{?RFC8489}} or
Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) {{?RFC5766}}.  In this case, the
Local Endpoint will resolve to a mixture of local and server reflexive
addresses. The Resolve() action on the Preconnection can be used to
discover these bindings:

~~~
[]LocalEndpoint, []RemoteEndpoint := Preconnection.Resolve()
~~~

The Resolve() call returns lists of Local Endpoints and Remote Endpoints,
that represent the concrete addresses, local and server reflexive, on which
a Rendezvous() for the Preconnection will listen for incoming Connections,
and to which it will attempt to establish connections.

An application that uses Rendezvous() to establish a peer-to-peer connection
in the presence of NATs will configure the Preconnection object with at least
one a Local Endpoint that supports NAT binding discovery. It will then Resolve()
the Preconnection, and pass the resulting list of Local Endpoint candidates to
the peer via a signalling protocol, for example as part of an ICE {{?RFC5245}}
exchange within SIP {{?RFC3261}} or WebRTC {{?RFC7478}}.  The peer will then,
via the same signalling channel, return the Remote Endpoint candidates.
The set of Remote Endpoint candidates are then configured onto the Preconnection:

~~~
Preconnection.AddRemote([]RemoteEndpoint)
~~~

The Rendezvous() Action can be initiated once both the Local Endpoint
candidates and the Remote Endpoint candidates retrieved from the peer via
the signalling channel have been added to the Preconnection.


If successful, the Rendezvous() Action returns a Connection object via a
RendezvousDone<> Event: 

~~~
Preconnection -> RendezvousDone<Connection>
~~~

The RendezvousDone<> Event occurs when a Connection is established with the
Remote Endpoint. For Connection-oriented transports, this occurs when the
transport-layer connection is established; for Connectionless transports,
it occurs when the first Message is received from the Remote Endpoint. The
resulting Connection is contained within the RendezvousDone<> Event, and is
ready to use as soon as it is passed to the application via the Event.
Changes made to a Preconnection after Rendezvous() has been called do
not have any effect on existing Connections. 

An EstablishmentError occurs either when the Properties and Security
Parameters of the Preconnection cannot be fulfilled for rendezvous or
cannot be reconciled with the Local and/or Remote Endpoints, when the Local
Endpoint or Remote Endpoint cannot be resolved, when no transport-layer
connection can be established to the Remote Endpoint, or when the
application is prohibited from rendezvous by policy:

~~~
Preconnection -> EstablishmentError<reason?>
~~~



## Connection Groups {#groups}

Connection Groups can be created using the Clone Action:

~~~
Connection := Connection.Clone(framer?)
~~~

Calling Clone on a Connection yields a Connection Group containing two Connections: the parent
Connection on which Clone was called, and a resulting cloned Connection.
The new Connection is actively openend, and it will send a Ready Event or an EstablishmentError Event.
Calling Clone on any of these Connections adds another Connection to
the Connection Group. Connections in a Connection Group share all
Connection Properties except `Connection Priority` (see {{conn-priority}}),
and these Connection Properties are entangled: Changing one of the
Connection Properties on one Connection in the Connection Group
automatically changes the Connection Property for all others. For example, changing
`Timeout for aborting Connection` (see
{{connTimeout}}) on one Connection in a Connection Group will automatically
make the same change to this Connection Property for all other Connections in the Connection Group.
Like all other Properties, `Connection Priority` is copied 
to the new Connection when calling Clone(), but in this case, a later change to the 
`Connection Priority` on one Connection does not change it on the
other Connections in the same Connection Group.

Message Properties are also not entangled.  For example,
changing `Lifetime` (see {{msgLifetime}}) of a Message will only affect a
single Message on a single Connection.

A new Connection created by Clone can have a Message Framer assigned via the optional
`framer` parameter of the Clone Action. If this parameter is not supplied, the
stack of Message Framers associated with a Connection is copied to 
the cloned Connection when calling Clone. Then, a cloned Connection 
has the same stack of Message Framers as the Connection from which they
are Cloned, but these Framers may internally maintain per-Connection state.

It is also possible to check which Connections belong to the same Connection Group.
Calling GroupedConnections() on a specific Connection returns a set of all Connections
in the same group.

~~~
[]Connection := Connection.GroupedConnections()
~~~

Connections will belong to the same group if the application previously called Clone.
Passive Connections can also be added to the same group -- e.g., when a Listener
receives a new Connection that is just a new stream of an already active multi-streaming
protocol instance.

If the underlying protocol supports multi-streaming, it is natural to use this
functionality to implement Clone. In that case, Connections in a Connection Group are
multiplexed together, giving them similar treatment not only inside endpoints,
but also across the end-to-end Internet path.

Note that calling Clone() can result in on-the-wire signaling, e.g., to open a new
transport connection, depending on the underlying Protocol Stack. When Clone() leads to
the opening of multiple such connections,
the Transport Services system will ensure consistency of
Connection Properties by uniformly applying them to all underlying connections
in a group. Even in such a case, there are possibilities for a Transport Services system
to implement prioritization within a Connection Group {{TCP-COUPLING}} {{?RFC8699}}.

Attempts to clone a Connection can result in a CloneError:

~~~
Connection -> CloneError<reason?>
~~~

The `Connection Priority` Connection Property operates on Connections in a Connection Group
using the same approach as in {{msg-priority}}: when allocating available network
capacity among Connections in a Connection Group, sends on Connections with
lower Priority values will be prioritized over sends on Connections with
higher Priority values. Capacity will be shared among these Connections according to
the Connection Group Transmission Scheduler property ({{connScheduler}}). 
See {{priority-in-taps}} for more.

# Managing Connections {#introspection}

During pre-establishment and after establishment, connections can be configured and queried using Connection
Properties, and asynchronous information may be available about the state of the
connection via Soft Errors.

Connection Properties represent the configuration and state of the selected
Protocol Stack(s) backing a Connection. These Connection Properties may be
Generic, applying regardless of transport protocol, or Specific, applicable to a
single implementation of a single transport protocol stack. Generic Connection
Properties are defined in {{connection-props}} below. Specific Protocol
Properties are defined in a transport- and implementation-specific way, and MUST
NOT be assumed to apply across different protocols. Attempts to set Specific
Protocol Properties on a protocol stack not containing that specific protocol
are simply ignored, and do not raise an error; however, too much reliance by an
application on Specific Protocol Properties can significantly reduce the
flexibility of a Transport Services implementation.

The application can set and query Connection Properties on a per-Connection
basis. Connection Properties that are not read-only can be set during
pre-establishment (see {{selection-props}}), as well as on connections directly using
the SetProperty action:

~~~
Connection.SetProperty(property, value)
~~~

Note that changing one of the Connection Properties on one Connection in a Connection Group
will also change it for all other Connections of that group; see further {{groups}}.

At any point, the application can query Connection Properties.

~~~
ConnectionProperties := Connection.GetProperties()
value := ConnectionProperties.Get(property)
if ConnectionProperties.Has(boolean_or_preference_property) then ...
~~~

Depending on the status of the connection, the queried Connection
Properties will include different information:

* The connection state, which can be one of the following:
  Establishing, Established, Closing, or Closed.

* Whether the connection can be used to send data. A connection can not be used
  for sending if the connection was created with the Selection Property
  `Direction of Communication` set to `unidirectional receive` or if a Message
  marked as `Final` was sent over this connection. See also {{msg-final}}.

* Whether the connection can be used to receive data. A connection cannot be
  used for reading if the connection was created with the Selection Property
  `Direction of Communication` set to `unidirectional send` or if a Message
  marked as `Final` was received. See {{receiving-final-messages}}. The latter
  is only supported by certain transport protocols, e.g., by TCP as half-closed
  connection.

* For Connections that are Established or Closing: Transport Properties that the
  application specified on the Preconnection. See {{selection-props}}.
  Selection properties of type `Preference` will be exposed as boolean values
  indicating whether or not the property applies to the selected transport.

* For Connections that are Established, Closing, or Closed: Selection
  ({{selection-props}}) and Connection Properties ({{connection-props}}) of the
  actual protocols that were selected and instantiated. Selection Properties
  indicate whether or not the Connection has or offers a certain Selection
  Property. The actually instantiated protocol stack might not match all
  Protocol Selection Properties that the application specified on the
  Preconnection. For example, a certain Protocol Selection Property that an
  application specified as Preferred might not actually be present in the chosen
  protocol stack because none of the currently available transport protocols had
  this feature.

* For Connections that are Established, additional properties of the path(s) in
  use. These properties can be derived from the local provisioning domain
  {{RFC7556}}, measurements by the Protocol Stack, or other sources.


## Generic Connection Properties {#connection-props}

Generic Connection Properties are defined independent of the chosen protocol stack
and therefore available on all Connections.

Many Connection Properties have a corresponding Selection Property that
enables applications to express their preference for protocols providing a supporting transport feature.


### Required Minimum Corruption Protection Coverage for Receiving {#conn-recv-checksum}

Name:
: recvChecksumLen

Type:
: Integer (non-negative with special value `Full Coverage`)

Default:
: Full Coverage

This property specifies the minimum number of bytes in a received
message that need to be covered by a checksum. A special value of 0 means
that a received packet does not need to have a non-zero checksum field. 
A receiving endpoint will not forward messages that have less coverage 
to the application. The application is responsible for handling
any corruption within the non-protected part of the message {{!RFC8085}}.

### Connection Priority {#conn-priority}

Name:
: connPrio

Type:
: Integer

Default:
: 100

This Property is a non-negative integer representing the relative inverse
priority (i.e., a lower value reflects a higher priority) of this Connection 
relative to other Connections in the same
Connection Group. It has no effect on Connections not part of a Connection
Group. As noted in {{groups}}, this property is not entangled when Connections
are cloned, i.e., changing the Priority on one Connection in a Connection Group 
does not change it on the other Connections in the same Connection Group. 
No guarantees of a specific behavior regarding Connection Priority are given;
a Transport Services system may ignore this property. See {{priority-in-taps}} for more details.

### Timeout for Aborting Connection {#connTimeout}

Name:
: connTimeout

Type:
: Numeric, with special value `Disabled`

Default:
: Disabled

This property specifies how long to wait before deciding that an active Connection has
failed when trying to reliably deliver data to the Remote Endpoint. Adjusting this Property
will only take effect when the underlying stack supports reliability. The special value
`Disabled` means that no timeout is scheduled.

### Timeout for keep alive packets {#keepAliveTimeout}

Name:
: keepAliveTimeout

Type:
: Numeric, with special value `Disabled`

Default:
: Implementation-defined

A Transport Services system can request a protocol that supports sending keep alive packets {{keepAlive}}.
This property specifies the maximum length of time an idle connection (one for which no transport
packets have been sent) should wait before 
the Local Endpoint sends a keep-alive packet to the Remote Endpoint. Adjusting this Property
will only take effect when the underlying stack supports sending keep-alive packets. 
Guidance on setting this value for datagram transports is 
provided in {{!RFC8085}}.
A value greater than the connection timeout ({{connTimeout}}), or the special value `Disabled`, will disable the sending of keep-alive packets.

### Connection Group Transmission Scheduler {#connScheduler}

Name:
: connScheduler

Type:
: Enumeration

Default:
: Weighted Fair Queueing (see Section 3.6 in {{?RFC8260}})

This property specifies which scheduler should be used among Connections within
a Connection Group, see {{groups}}. The set of schedulers can
be taken from {{?RFC8260}}.

### Capacity Profile {#prop-cap-profile}

Name:
: connCapacityProfile

This property specifies the desired network treatment for traffic sent by the
application and the tradeoffs the application is prepared to make in path and
protocol selection to receive that desired treatment. When the capacity profile
is set to a value other than Default, the Transport Services system SHOULD select paths
and configure protocols to optimize the tradeoff between delay, delay variation, and
efficient use of the available capacity based on the capacity profile specified. How this is realized
is implementation-specific. The Capacity Profile MAY also be used
to set markings on the wire for Protocol Stacks supporting this. 
Recommendations for use with DSCP are provided below for each profile; note that
when a Connection is multiplexed, the guidelines in Section 6 of {{?RFC7657}} apply.
  
The following values are valid for the Capacity Profile:

  Default:
  : The application provides no information about its expected capacity
  profile. Transport Services system implementations that
  map the requested capacity profile onto per-connection DSCP signaling 
  SHOULD assign the DSCP Default Forwarding {{?RFC2474}} Per Hop Behaviour (PHB).

  Scavenger:
  : The application is not interactive. It expects to send
  and/or receive data without any urgency. This can, for example, be used to
  select protocol stacks with scavenger transmission control and/or to assign
  the traffic to a lower-effort service. Transport Services system implementations that
  map the requested capacity profile onto per-connection DSCP signaling
  SHOULD assign the DSCP Less than Best Effort
  {{?RFC8622}} PHB.

  Low Latency/Interactive:
  : The application is interactive, and prefers loss to
  latency. Response time should be optimized at the expense of delay variation
  and efficient use of the available capacity when sending on this connection. This can be
  used by the system to disable the coalescing of multiple small Messages into
  larger packets (Nagle's algorithm); to prefer immediate acknowledgment from
  the peer endpoint when supported by the underlying transport; and so on.
  Transport Services system implementations that map the requested capacity profile onto per-connection DSCP signaling without multiplexing SHOULD assign a DSCP Assured Forwarding (AF41,AF42,AF43,AF44) {{?RFC2597}} PHB. Inelastic traffic that is expected to conform to the configured network service rate could be mapped to the DSCP Expedited Forwarding {{?RFC3246}} or {{?RFC5865}} PHBs.
  
  Low Latency/Non-Interactive:
  : The application prefers loss to latency, but is
  not interactive. Response time should be optimized at the expense of delay
  variation and efficient use of the available capacity when sending on this connection. Transport
  system implementations that map the requested capacity profile onto
  per-connection DSCP signaling without multiplexing SHOULD assign a DSCP
  Assured Forwarding (AF21,AF22,AF23,AF24) {{?RFC2597}} PHB.

  Constant-Rate Streaming:
  : The application expects to send/receive data at a
  constant rate after Connection establishment. Delay and delay variation should
  be minimized at the expense of efficient use of the available capacity. 
  This implies that the Connection might fail if the Path is unable to maintain the desired rate.
  A transport can interpret this capacity profile as preferring a circuit
  breaker {{?RFC8084}} to a rate-adaptive congestion controller. Transport
  system implementations that map the requested capacity profile onto
  per-connection DSCP signaling without multiplexing SHOULD assign a DSCP
  Assured Forwarding (AF31,AF32,AF33,AF34) {{?RFC2597}} PHB.

  Capacity-Seeking:
  : The application expects to send/receive data at the
  maximum rate allowed by its congestion controller over a relatively long
  period of time. Transport Services system implementations that map the requested
  capacity profile onto per-connection DSCP signaling without multiplexing
  SHOULD assign a DSCP Assured Forwarding (AF11,AF12,AF13,AF14) {{?RFC2597}} PHB
  per Section 4.8 of {{?RFC4594}}. 

The Capacity Profile for a selected protocol stack may be modified on a
per-Message basis using the Transmission Profile Message Property; see
{{send-profile}}.

### Policy for using Multipath Transports {#multipathPolicy}

Name:
: multipathPolicy

Type:
: Enumeration

Default:
: Handover

This property specifies the local policy for transferring data across multiple paths between the same end hosts if Multipath Transport is not set to Disabled (see {{multipath-mode}}). Possible values are:

Handover:
: The connection ought only to attempt to migrate between different paths when the original path is lost or becomes unusable. The thresholds used to declare a path unusable are implementation specific.

Interactive:
: The connection ought only to attempt to minimize the latency for interactive traffic patterns by transmitting data across multiple paths when this is beneficial.
The goal of minimizing the latency will be balanced against the cost of each of these paths. Depending on the cost of the
lower-latency path, the scheduling might choose to use a higher-latency path. Traffic can be scheduled such that data may be transmitted
on multiple paths in parallel to achieve a lower latency. The specific scheduling algorithm is implementation-specific.

Aggregate:
: The connection ought to attempt to use multiple paths in parallel to maximize available capacity and possibly overcome the capacity limitations of the individual paths. The actual strategy is implementation specific.

Note that this is a local choice – the Remote Endpoint can choose a different policy.

### Bounds on Send or Receive Rate

Name:
: minSendRate / minRecvRate / maxSendRate / maxRecvRate

Type:
: Numeric (with special value `Unlimited`) / Numeric (with special value `Unlimited`) / Numeric (with special value `Unlimited`) / Numeric (with special value `Unlimited`)

Default:
: Unlimited / Unlimited / Unlimited / Unlimited

This property specifies an upper-bound rate that a transfer is not expected to
exceed (even if flow control and congestion control allow higher rates), and/or a
lower-bound rate below which the application does not deem
it will be useful. These are specified in bits per second. 
The special value `Unlimited` indicates that no bound is specified.

### Group Connection Limit

Name:
: groupConnLimit

Type:
: Numeric (with special value `Unlimited`)

Default:
: Unlimited

This property controls the number of Connections that can be accepted from
a peer as new members of the Connection's group. Similar to SetNewConnectionLimit(),
this limits the number of ConnectionReceived Events that will occur, but constrained
to the group of the Connection associated with this property. For a multi-streaming transport,
this limits the number of allowed streams.

### Isolate Session {#isolateSession}
Name:
: isolateSession

Type:
: Boolean

Default:
: false

When set to true, this property will initiate new Connections using as little
cached information (such as session tickets or cookies) as possible from
previous connections that are not in the same Connection Group. Any state generated by this
Connection will only be shared with Connections in the same Connection Group. Cloned Connections
will use saved state from within the Connection Group.
This is used for separating Connection Contexts as specified in {{I-D.ietf-taps-arch}}.

Note that this does not guarantee no leakage of information, as
implementations may not be able to fully isolate all caches (e.g. RTT
estimates). Note that this property may degrade connection performance.

### Read-only Connection Properties {#read-only-conn-prop}

The following generic Connection Properties are read-only, i.e. they cannot be changed by an application.

#### Maximum Message Size Concurrent with Connection Establishment {#size-safelyreplayable}

Name:
: zeroRttMsgMaxLen

Type:
: Integer

This property represents the maximum Message size that can be sent
before or during Connection establishment, see also {{msg-safelyreplayable}}.
It is given in Bytes.

#### Maximum Message Size Before Fragmentation or Segmentation {#conn-max-msg-notfrag}

Name:
: singularTransmissionMsgMaxLen

Type:
: Integer

This property, if applicable, represents the maximum Message size that can be
sent without incurring network-layer fragmentation at the sender. 
It exposes a value to the application
based on the Maximum Packet Size (MPS) as described in Datagram PLPMTUD {{?RFC8899}}.
This can allow a sending stack to avoid unwanted fragmentation at the 
network-layer or segmentation by the transport layer. 

#### Maximum Message Size on Send {#conn-max-msg-send}

Name:
: sendMsgMaxLen

Type:
: Integer

This property represents the maximum Message size that an application can send.

#### Maximum Message Size on Receive {#conn-max-msg-recv}

Name:
: recvMsgMaxLen

Type:
: Integer

This numeric property represents the maximum Message size that an application can receive.


## TCP-specific Properties: User Timeout Option (UTO) {#tcp-uto}

These properties specify configurations for the User Timeout Option (UTO), 
in the case that TCP becomes the chosen transport protocol. 
Implementation is optional and useful only if TCP is implemented in the Transport Services system.

These TCP-specific properties are included here because the feature `Suggest
timeout to the peer` is part of the minimal set of Transport Services
{{?RFC8923}}, where this feature was categorized as "functional".
This means that when an implementation offers this feature, it has to expose an
interface to it to the application. Otherwise, the implementation might
violate assumptions by the application, which could cause the application to
fail.

All of the below properties are optional (e.g., it is possible to specify `User Timeout Enabled` as true,
but not specify an Advertised User Timeout value; in this case, the TCP default will be used).
These properties reflect the API extension specified in Section 3 of {{?RFC5482}}.

### Advertised User Timeout 

Name: 
: tcp.userTimeoutValue

Type: 
: Integer

Default:
: the TCP default

This time value is advertised via the TCP User Timeout Option (UTO) {{?RFC5482}} at the Remote Endpoint
to adapt its own `Timeout for aborting Connection` (see {{connTimeout}}) value.

### User Timeout Enabled 

Name: 
: tcp.userTimeout

Type:
: Boolean

Default:
: false

This property controls whether the UTO option is enabled for a
connection. This applies to both sending and receiving.

### Timeout Changeable

Name:
: tcp.userTimeoutRecv

Type:
: Boolean

Default:
: true

This property controls whether the `Timeout for aborting Connection` (see {{connTimeout}})
may be changed
based on a UTO option received from the remote peer. This boolean becomes false when
`Timeout for aborting Connection` (see {{connTimeout}}) is used.


## Connection Lifecycle Events

During the lifetime of a connection there are events that can occur when configured.

### Soft Errors

Asynchronous introspection is also possible, via the SoftError Event. This event
informs the application about the receipt and contents of an ICMP error message related to the Connection. This will only happen if the underlying protocol stack supports access to soft errors; however, even if the underlying stack supports it, there
is no guarantee that a soft error will be signaled.

~~~
Connection -> SoftError<>
~~~


### Path change {#conn-path-change}

This event notifies the application when at least one of the paths underlying a Connection has changed. Changes occur
on a single path when the PMTU changes as well as when multiple paths are used
and paths are added or removed, or a handover has been performed.

~~~
Connection -> PathChange<>
~~~

# Data Transfer {#datatransfer}

Data is sent and received as Messages, which allows the application
to communicate the boundaries of the data being transferred.

## Messages and Framers {#msg}

Each Message has an optional Message Context, which allows to add Message Properties, identify Send Events related to a specific Message or to inspect meta-data related to the Message sent. Framers can be used to extend or modify the message data with additional information that can be processed at the receiver to detect message boundaries.


### Message Contexts {#msg-ctx}

Using the MessageContext object, the application can set and retrieve meta-data of the message, including Message Properties (see {{message-props}}) and framing meta-data (see {{framing-meta}}).
Therefore, a MessageContext object can be passed to the Send action and is returned by each Send and Receive related event.

Message Properties can be set and queried using the Message Context:

~~~
MessageContext.add(scope?, parameter, value)
PropertyValue := MessageContext.get(scope?, property)
~~~

To get or set Message Properties, the optional scope parameter is left empty. To get or set meta-data for a Framer, the application has to pass a reference to this Framer as the scope parameter.

For MessageContexts returned by send Events (see {{send-events}}) and receive Events (see {{receive-events}}), the application can query information about the Local and Remote Endpoint:

~~~
RemoteEndpoint := MessageContext.GetRemoteEndpoint()
LocalEndpoint := MessageContext.GetLocalEndpoint()
~~~

### Message Framers {#framing}

Although most applications communicate over a network using well-formed
Messages, the boundaries and metadata of the Messages are often not
directly communicated by the transport protocol itself. For example,
HTTP applications send and receive HTTP messages over a byte-stream
transport, requiring that the boundaries of HTTP messages be parsed 
from the stream of bytes.

Message Framers allow extending a Connection's Protocol Stack to define
how to encapsulate or encode outbound Messages, and how to decapsulate
or decode inbound data into Messages. Message Framers allow message
boundaries to be preserved when using a Connection object, even when
using byte-stream transports. This is designed based on the fact
that many of the current application protocols evolved over TCP, which
does not provide message boundary preservation, and since many of these
protocols require message boundaries to function, each application layer
protocol has defined its own framing.

To use a Message Framer, the application adds it to its Preconnection object.
Then, the Message Framer can intercept all calls to Send() or Receive()
on a Connection to add Message semantics, in addition to interacting with
the setup and teardown of the Connection. A Framer can start sending data
before the application sends data if the framing protocol requires a prefix
or handshake (see {{?RFC8229}} for an example of such a framing protocol).

~~~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-framer-stack title="Protocol Stack showing a Message Framer"}

Note that while Message Framers add the most value when placed above
a protocol that otherwise does not preserve message boundaries, they can
also be used with datagram- or message-based protocols. In these cases,
they add an additional transformation to further encode or encapsulate,
and can potentially support packing multiple application-layer Messages
into individual transport datagrams.

The API to implement a Message Framer can vary depending on the implementation;
guidance on implementing Message Framers can be found in {{I-D.ietf-taps-impl}}.

#### Adding Message Framers to Connections

The Message Framer object can be added to one or more Preconnections
to run on top of transport protocols. Multiple Framers may be added to a Preconnection;
in this case, the Framers operate as a framing stack, i.e. the last one added runs 
first when framing outbound messages, and last when parsing inbound data.

The following example adds a basic HTTP Message Framer to a Preconnection:

~~~
framer := NewHTTPMessageFramer()
Preconnection.AddFramer(framer)
~~~

Since Message Framers pass from Preconnection to Listener or Connection, addition of
Framers must happen before any operation that may result in the creation of a Connection.

#### Framing Meta-Data {#framing-meta}

When sending Messages, applications can add Framer-specific
key/value pairs to a MessageContext ({{msg-ctx}}).
This mechanism can be used, for example, to set the type of a Message for a TLV format.
The namespace of values is custom for each unique Message Framer.

~~~
messageContext := NewMessageContext()
messageContext.add(framer, key, value)
Connection.Send(messageData, messageContext)
~~~

When an application receives a MessageContext in a Receive event,
it can also look to see if a value was set by a specific Message Framer.

~~~
messageContext.get(framer, key) -> value
~~~

For example, if an HTTP Message Framer is used, the values could correspond
to HTTP headers:

~~~
httpFramer := NewHTTPMessageFramer()
...
messageContext := NewMessageContext()
messageContext.add(httpFramer, "accept", "text/html")
~~~


### Message Properties {#message-props}

Applications needing to annotate the Messages they send with extra information
(for example, to control how data is scheduled and processed by the transport protocols supporting the
Connection) can include this information in the Message Context passed to the Send Action. For other uses of the message context, see {{msg-ctx}}.

Message Properties are per-Message, not per-Send if partial Messages
are sent ({{send-partial}}). All data blocks associated with a single Message
share properties specified in the Message Contexts. For example, it would not
make sense to have the beginning of a Message expire, but allow the end of a
Message to still be sent.

A MessageContext object contains metadata for the Messages to be sent or received.

~~~
messageData := "hello"
messageContext := NewMessageContext()
messageContext.add(parameter, value)
Connection.Send(messageData, messageContext)
~~~

The simpler form of Send, which does not take any messageContext, is equivalent to passing a default MessageContext without adding any Message Properties.

If an application wants to override Message Properties for a specific message,
it can acquire an empty MessageContext Object and add all desired Message
Properties to that Object. It can then reuse the same messageContext Object
for sending multiple Messages with the same properties.

Properties can be added to a MessageContext object only before the context is used
for sending. Once a messageContext has been used with a Send call, it is
invalid to modify any of its properties.

The Message Properties could be inconsistent with the properties of the Protocol Stacks
underlying the Connection on which a given Message is sent. For example,
a Protocol Stack must be able to provide ordering if the `msgOrdered`
property of a Message is enabled. Sending a Message with Message Properties
inconsistent with the Selection Properties of the Connection yields an error.

Connection Properties describe the default behavior for all Messages on a 
Connection. If a Message Property contradicts a Connection Property, and 
if this per-Message behavior can be supported, it overrides the Connection 
Property for the specific Message. For example, if 
`Reliable Data Transfer (Connection)` is set to `Require` and a protocol 
with configurable per-Message reliability is used, setting 
`Reliable Data Transfer (Message)` to `false` for a particular Message will 
allow this Message to be sent without any reliability guarantees. Changing 
the Reliable Data Transfer property on Messages is only possible for 
Connections that were established enabling the Selection Property 
`Configure Per-Message Reliability`.

The following Message Properties are supported:

#### Lifetime {#msgLifetime}

Name:
: msgLifetime

Type:
: Numeric

Default:
: infinite

The Lifetime specifies how long a particular Message can wait to be sent to the
Remote Endpoint before it is irrelevant and no longer needs to be
(re-)transmitted. This is a hint to the Transport Services system -- it is not guaranteed
that a Message will not be sent when its Lifetime has expired.

Setting a Message's Lifetime to infinite indicates that the application does
not wish to apply a time constraint on the transmission of the Message, but it does not express a need for
reliable delivery; reliability is adjustable per Message via the `Reliable Data Transfer (Message)`
property (see {{msg-reliable-message}}). The type and units of Lifetime are implementation-specific.

#### Priority {#msg-priority}

Name:
: msgPrio

Type:
: Integer (non-negative)

Default:
: 100

This property specifies the priority of a Message, relative to other Messages sent over the
same Connection.

A Message with Priority 0 will yield to a Message with Priority 1, which will
yield to a Message with Priority 2, and so on. Priorities may be used as a
sender-side scheduling construct only, or be used to specify priorities on the
wire for Protocol Stacks supporting prioritization.

Note that this property is not a per-message override of the Connection Priority
- see {{conn-priority}}. The Priority properties may interact, but can be used
independently and be realized by different mechanisms; see {{priority-in-taps}}.

#### Ordered {#msgOrdered}

Name:
: msgOrdered

Type:
: Boolean

Default:
: the queried Boolean value of the Selection Property `reliability` ({{prop-reliable}})

The order in which Messages were submitted for transmission via the Send Action will be preserved on delivery via Receive<> events for all Messages on a Connection that have this Message Property set to true.

If false, the Message is delivered to the receiving application without preserving the ordering.
This property is used for protocols that support preservation of data ordering,
see {{prop-ordering}}, but allow out-of-order delivery for certain messages, e.g., by multiplexing independent messages onto
different streams.

#### Safely Replayable {#msg-safelyreplayable}

Name:
: safelyReplayable

Type:
: Boolean

Default:
: false

If true, Safely Replayable specifies that a Message is safe to send to the Remote Endpoint
more than once for a single Send Action. It marks the data as safe for
certain 0-RTT establishment techniques, where retransmission of the 0-RTT data
may cause the remote application to receive the Message multiple times.

For protocols that do not protect against duplicated messages,
e.g., UDP, all messages need to be marked as `Safely Replayable`.
To enable protocol selection to choose such a protocol,
`Safely Replayable` needs to be added to the TransportProperties passed to the
Preconnection. If such a protocol was chosen, disabling `Safely Replayable` on
individual messages MUST result in a SendError.

#### Final {#msg-final}

Name:
: final

Type:
: Boolean

Default:
: false

If true, this indicates a Message is the last that
the application will send on a Connection. This allows underlying protocols
to indicate to the Remote Endpoint that the Connection has been effectively
closed in the sending direction. For example, TCP-based Connections can
send a FIN once a Message marked as Final has been completely sent,
indicated by marking endOfMessage. Protocols that do not support signalling
the end of a Connection in a given direction will ignore this property.

A Final Message must always be sorted to the end of a list of Messages.
The Final property overrides Priority and any other property that would re-order
Messages. If another Message is sent after a Message marked as Final has already
been sent on a Connection, the Send Action for the new Message will cause a SendError Event.

#### Sending Corruption Protection Length {#msg-checksum}

Name:
: msgChecksumLen

Type:
: Integer (non-negative with special value `Full Coverage`)

Default:
: Full Coverage

This property specifies the minimum length of the section of a sent Message,
starting from byte 0, that the application requires to be delivered without
corruption due to lower layer errors. It is used to specify options for simple
integrity protection via checksums. A value of 0 means that no checksum
needs to be calculated, and `Full Coverage` means
that the entire Message needs to be protected by a checksum. Only `Full Coverage` is
guaranteed, any other requests are advisory, which may result in `Full Coverage` being applied.

#### Reliable Data Transfer (Message) {#msg-reliable-message}

Name:
: msgReliable

Type:
: Boolean

Default:
: the queried Boolean value of the Selection Property `reliability` ({{prop-reliable}})

When true, this property specifies that a Message should be sent in such a way
that the transport protocol ensures all data is received on the other side
without corruption. Changing the `Reliable Data Transfer` property on Messages
is only possible for Connections that were established enabling the Selection Property `Configure Per-Message Reliability`.
When this is not the case, changing `msgReliable` will generate an error.

Disabling this property indicates that the Transport Services system may disable retransmissions
or other reliability mechanisms for this particular Message, but such disabling is not guaranteed.

#### Message Capacity Profile Override {#send-profile}

Name:
: msgCapacityProfile

Type:
: Enumeration

Default:
: inherited from the Connection Property `connCapacityProfile` ({{prop-cap-profile}})


This enumerated property specifies the application's preferred tradeoffs for
sending this Message; it is a per-Message override of the Capacity Profile
connection property (see {{prop-cap-profile}}).


#### No Network-Layer Fragmentation {#send-singular}

Name:
: noFragmentation

Type:
: Boolean

Default:
: false

This property specifies that a message should be sent and received 
without network-layer fragmentation, if possible. It can be used
to avoid network layer fragmentation when transport segmentation is prefered.

This only takes effect when the transport uses a network layer that supports this functionality.
When it does take effect, setting this property to
true will cause the sender to avoid network-layer source frgementation.
When using IPv4, this will result in the Don't Fragment bit being set in the IP header.

Attempts to send a message with this property that result in a size greater than the
transport's current estimate of its maximum packet size (`singularTransmissionMsgMaxLen`)
can result in transport segmentation when permitted, or in a `SendError`.

Note: `noSegmentation` should be used when it is desired to only send a message within
a single network packet.

#### No Segmentation {#no-transport-fragmentation}

Name:
: noSegmentation

Type:
: Boolean

Default:
: false

When set to true, this property requests the transport layer
to not provide segmentation of messages larger than the
maximum size permitted by the network layer, and also
to avoid network-layer source fragmentation of messages. 
When running over IPv4, setting this property to
true can result in a sending endpount setting the 
Don't Fragment bit in the IPv4 header of packets generated by the
transport layer.  An
attempt to send a message that results in a size greater than the
transport's current estimate of its maximum packet size (`singularTransmissionMsgMaxLen`)
will result in a SendError.
This only takes effect when the transport and network layer
support this functionality.

## Sending Data {#sending}

Once a Connection has been established, it can be used for sending Messages.
By default, Send enqueues a complete Message,
and takes optional per-Message properties (see {{send-basic}}). All Send actions
are asynchronous, and deliver Events (see {{send-events}}). Sending partial
Messages for streaming large data is also supported (see {{send-partial}}).

Messages are sent on a Connection using the Send action:

~~~
Connection.Send(messageData, messageContext?, endOfMessage?)
~~~

where messageData is the data object to send, and messageContext allows
adding Message Properties, identifying Send Events related to a specific
Message or inspecting meta-data related to the Message sent (see {{msg-ctx}}).

The optional endOfMessage parameter supports partial sending and is described in
{{send-partial}}.


### Basic Sending {#send-basic}

The most basic form of sending on a connection involves enqueuing a single Data
block as a complete Message with default Message Properties.

~~~
messageData := "hello"
Connection.Send(messageData)
~~~

The interpretation of a Message to be sent is dependent on the implementation, and
on the constraints on the Protocol Stacks implied by the Connection’s transport properties.
For example, a Message may be a single datagram for UDP Connections; or an HTTP
Request for HTTP Connections.

Some transport protocols can deliver arbitrarily sized Messages, but other
protocols constrain the maximum Message size. Applications can query the
Connection Property "Maximum Message size on send" ({{conn-max-msg-send}}) to determine the maximum size
allowed for a single Message. If a Message is too large to fit in the Maximum Message
Size for the Connection, the Send will fail with a SendError event ({{send-error}}). For
example, it is invalid to send a Message over a UDP connection that is larger than
the available datagram sending size.

### Send Events {#send-events}

Like all Actions in this interface, the Send Action is asynchronous. There are
several Events that can be delivered in response to Sending a Message.
Exactly one Event (Sent, Expired, or SendError) will be delivered in response
to each call to Send.

Note that if partial Sends are used ({{send-partial}}), there will still be exactly
one Send Event delivered for each call to Send. For example, if a Message
expired while two requests to Send data for that Message are outstanding,
there will be two Expired events delivered.

The interface should allow the application to correlate which Send Action resulted
in a particular Send Event. The manner in which this correlation is indicated
is implementation-specific.

#### Sent {#sent}

~~~
Connection -> Sent<messageContext>
~~~

The Sent Event occurs when a previous Send Action has completed, i.e., when
the data derived from the Message has been passed down or through the
underlying Protocol Stack and is no longer the responsibility of
this interface. The exact disposition of the Message (i.e.,
whether it has actually been transmitted, moved into a buffer on the network
interface, moved into a kernel buffer, and so on) when the Sent Event occurs
is implementation-specific. The Sent Event contains a reference to the Message
Context of the Message to which it applies.

Sent Events allow an application to obtain an understanding of the amount
of buffering it creates. That is, if an application calls the Send Action multiple
times without waiting for a Sent Event, it has created more buffer inside the
Transport Services system than an application that always waits for the Sent Event before
calling the next Send Action.

#### Expired {#expired}

~~~
Connection -> Expired<messageContext>
~~~

The Expired Event occurs when a previous Send Action expired before completion;
i.e. when the Message was not sent before its Lifetime (see {{msgLifetime}})
expired. This is separate from SendError, as it is an expected behavior for
partially reliable transports. The Expired Event contains a reference to the
Message Context of the Message to which it applies.

#### SendError {#send-error}

~~~
Connection -> SendError<messageContext, reason?>
~~~

A SendError occurs when a Message was not sent due to an error condition:
an attempt to send a Message which is too large for the system and
Protocol Stack to handle, some failure of the underlying Protocol Stack, or a
set of Message Properties not consistent with the Connection's transport
properties. The SendError contains a reference to the Message Context of the
Message to which it applies.

### Partial Sends {#send-partial}

It is not always possible for an application to send all data associated with
a Message in a single Send Action. The Message data may be too large for
the application to hold in memory at one time, or the length of the Message
may be unknown or unbounded.

Partial Message sending is supported by passing an endOfMessage boolean
parameter to the Send Action. This value is always true by default, and
the simpler forms of Send are equivalent to passing true for endOfMessage.

The following example sends a Message in two separate calls to Send.

~~~
messageContext := NewMessageContext()
messageContext.add(parameter, value)

messageData := "hel"
endOfMessage := false
Connection.Send(messageData, messageContext, endOfMessage)

messageData := "lo"
endOfMessage := true
Connection.Send(messageData, messageContext, endOfMessage)
~~~

All data sent with the same MessageContext object will be treated as belonging
to the same Message, and will constitute an in-order series until the
endOfMessage is marked.

### Batching Sends {#send-batching}

To reduce the overhead of sending multiple small Messages on a Connection, the
application could batch several Send Actions together. This provides a hint to
the system that the sending of these Messages ought to be coalesced when possible,
and that sending any of the batched Messages can be delayed until the last Message
in the batch is enqueued.

The semantics for starting and ending a batch can be implementation-specific, but need
to allow multiple Send Actions to be enqueued.

~~~
Connection.StartBatch()
Connection.Send(messageData)
Connection.Send(messageData)
Connection.EndBatch()
~~~

### Send on Active Open: InitiateWithSend {#initiate-and-send}

For application-layer protocols where the Connection initiator also sends the
first message, the InitiateWithSend() action combines Connection initiation with
a first Message sent:

~~~
Connection := Preconnection.InitiateWithSend(messageData, messageContext?, timeout?)
~~~

Whenever possible, a messageContext should be provided to declare the Message passed to InitiateWithSend
as `Safely Replayable`. This allows the Transport Services system to make use of 0-RTT establishment in case this is supported
by the available protocol stacks. When the selected stack(s) do not support transmitting data upon connection
establishment, InitiateWithSend is identical to Initiate() followed by Send().

Neither partial sends nor send batching are supported by InitiateWithSend().

The Events that may be sent after InitiateWithSend() are equivalent to those
that would be sent by an invocation of Initiate() followed immediately by an
invocation of Send(), with the caveat that a send failure that occurs because
the Connection could not be established will not result in a
SendError separate from the InitiateError signaling the failure of Connection
establishment.

### Priority in Transport Services {#priority-in-taps}

The Transport Services interface provides two properties to allow a sender 
to signal the relative priority of data transmission: the Priority Message 
Property {{msg-priority}}, and the Connection Priority Connection Property 
{{conn-priority}}. These properties are designed to allow the expression 
and implementation of a wide variety of approaches to transmission priority in 
the transport and application layer, including those which do not appear on
the wire (affecting only sender-side transmission scheduling) as well as those
that do (e.g. {{?I-D.ietf-httpbis-priority}}.

A Transport Services system gives no guarantees about how its expression of
relative priorities will be realized. However, the Transport Services system will
seek to ensure that performance of relatively-prioritized connections and
messages is not worse with respect to those connections and messages than
an equivalent configuration in which all prioritization properties are left 
at their defaults.

The Transport Services interface does order Connection Priority over 
the Priority Message Property. In the absense of other externalities
(e.g., transport-layer flow control), a priority 1 Message on a priority 0
Connection will be sent before a priority 0 Message on a priority 1 
Connection in the same group.

## Receiving Data {#receiving}

Once a Connection is established, it can be used for receiving data (unless the
`Direction of Communication` property is set to `unidirectional send`). As with
sending, the data is received in Messages. Receiving is an asynchronous
operation, in which each call to Receive enqueues a request to receive new
data from the connection. Once data has been received, or an error is encountered,
an event will be delivered to complete any pending Receive requests (see {{receive-events}}).
If Messages arrive at the Transport Services system before Receive requests are issued,
ensuing Receive requests will first operate on these Messages before awaiting any further Messages.

### Enqueuing Receives

Receive takes two parameters to specify the length of data that an application
is willing to receive, both of which are optional and have default values if not
specified.

~~~
Connection.Receive(minIncompleteLength?, maxLength?)
~~~

By default, Receive will try to deliver complete Messages in a single event ({{receive-complete}}).

The application can set a minIncompleteLength value to indicate the smallest partial
Message data size in bytes that should be delivered in response to this Receive. By default,
this value is infinite, which means that only complete Messages should be delivered (see {{receive-partial}}
and {{framing}} for more information on how this is accomplished).
If this value is set to some smaller value, the associated receive event will be triggered
only when at least that many bytes are available, or the Message is complete with fewer
bytes, or the system needs to free up memory. Applications should always
check the length of the data delivered to the receive event and not assume
it will be as long as minIncompleteLength in the case of shorter complete Messages
or memory issues.

The maxLength argument indicates the maximum size of a Message in bytes
that the application is currently prepared to receive. The default
value for maxLength is infinite. If an incoming Message is larger than the
minimum of this size and the maximum Message size on receive for
the Connection's Protocol Stack, it will be delivered via ReceivedPartial
events ({{receive-partial}}).

Note that maxLength does not guarantee that the application will receive that many
bytes if they are available; the interface could return ReceivedPartial events with less
data than maxLength according to implementation constraints. Note also that maxLength
and minIncompleteLength are intended only to manage buffering, and are not interpreted
as a receiver preference for message reordering.

### Receive Events {#receive-events}

Each call to Receive will be paired with a single Receive Event, which can be a success
or an error. This allows an application to provide backpressure to the transport stack
when it is temporarily not ready to receive messages.

The interface should allow the application to correlate which call to Receive resulted
in a particular Receive Event. The manner in which this correlation is indicated
is implementation-specific.

#### Received {#receive-complete}

~~~
Connection -> Received<messageData, messageContext>
~~~

A Received event indicates the delivery of a complete Message.
It contains two objects, the received bytes as messageData, and the metadata and properties of the received Message as messageContext.

The messageData object provides access to the bytes that were received for this Message, along with the length of the byte array.
The messageContext is provided to enable retrieving metadata about the message and referring to the message, e.g., to send replies and map responses to their requests. See {{msg-ctx}} for details.

See {{framing}} for handling Message framing in situations where the Protocol
Stack only provides a byte-stream transport.

#### ReceivedPartial {#receive-partial}

~~~
Connection -> ReceivedPartial<messageData, messageContext, endOfMessage>
~~~

If a complete Message cannot be delivered in one event, one part of the Message
can be delivered with a ReceivedPartial event. To continue to receive more
of the same Message, the application must invoke Receive again.

Multiple invocations of ReceivedPartial deliver data for the same Message by
passing the same MessageContext, until the endOfMessage flag is delivered or a
ReceiveError occurs. All partial blocks of a single Message are delivered in
order without gaps. This event does not support delivering discontiguous partial
Messages. If, for example, Message A is divided into three pieces (A1, A2, A3) and
Message B is divided into three pieces (B1, B2, B3), the ReceivedPartial may deliver
them in a sequence like this: A1, B1, B2, A2, A3, B3, because the messageContext
allows the application to identify the pieces as belonging to Message A and B, respectively.
However, a sequence like: A1, A3 will never occur.

If the minIncompleteLength in the Receive request was set to be infinite (indicating
a request to receive only complete Messages), the ReceivedPartial event may still be
delivered if one of the following conditions is true:

* the underlying Protocol Stack supports message boundary preservation, and
  the size of the Message is larger than the buffers available for a single
  message;
* the underlying Protocol Stack does not support message boundary
  preservation, and the Message Framer (see {{framing}}) cannot determine
  the end of the message using the buffer space it has available; or
* the underlying Protocol Stack does not support message boundary
  preservation, and no Message Framer was supplied by the application

Note that in the absence of message boundary preservation or
a Message Framer, all bytes received on the Connection will be represented as one
large Message of indeterminate length.

#### ReceiveError {#receive-error}

~~~
Connection -> ReceiveError<messageContext, reason?>
~~~

A ReceiveError occurs when data is received by the underlying Protocol Stack
that cannot be fully retrieved or parsed, or when some other indication is
received that reception has failed. In contrast, conditions that irrevocably lead to
the termination of the Connection are instead signaled using ConnectionError
(see {{termination}}).

The ReceiveError event passes an optional associated MessageContext. This can
indicate that a Message that was being partially received previously, but had not
completed, encountered an error and will not be completed.


### Receive Message Properties {#recv-meta}

Each Message Context may contain metadata from protocols in the Protocol Stack;
which metadata is available is Protocol Stack dependent. These are exposed through additional read-only Message Properties that can be queried from the MessageContext object (see {{msg-ctx}}) passed by the receive event.
The following metadata values are supported:

#### UDP(-Lite)-specific Property: ECN {#receive-ecn}

When available, Message metadata carries the value of the Explicit Congestion
Notification (ECN) field. This information can be used for logging and debugging, 
and for building applications that need access to information about
the transport internals for their own operation. This property is specific to UDP
and UDP-Lite because these protocols do not implement congestion control,
and hence expose this functionality to the application.

#### Early Data {#receive-early}

In some cases it can be valuable to know whether data was read as part of early
data transfer (before connection establishment has finished). This is useful if
applications need to treat early data separately,
e.g., if early data has different security properties than data sent after
connection establishment. In the case of TLS 1.3, client early data can be replayed
maliciously (see {{!RFC8446}}). Thus, receivers might wish to perform additional
checks for early data to ensure it is safely replayable. If TLS 1.3 is available
and the recipient Message was sent as part of early data, the corresponding metadata carries
a flag indicating as such. If early data is enabled, applications should check this metadata
field for Messages received during connection establishment and respond accordingly.

#### Receiving Final Messages

The Message Context can indicate whether or not this Message is
the Final Message on a Connection. For any Message that is marked as Final,
the application can assume that there will be no more Messages received on the
Connection once the Message has been completely delivered. This corresponds
to the Final property that may be marked on a sent Message, see {{msg-final}}.

Some transport protocols and peers do not support signaling of the Final property.
Applications therefore should not rely on receiving a Message marked Final to know
that the sending endpoint is done sending on a connection.

Any calls to Receive once the Final Message has been delivered will result in errors.

# Connection Termination {#termination}

Close terminates a Connection after satisfying all the requirements that were
specified regarding the delivery of Messages that the application has already
given to the Transport Services system. For example, if reliable delivery was requested
for a Message handed over before calling Close, the Closed Event will signify
that this Message has indeed been delivered. This action does not affect any other Connection
in the same Connection Group.

~~~
Connection.Close()
~~~

The Closed Event informs the application that the Remote Endpoint has closed the
Connection. There is no guarantee that a remote Close will indeed be
signaled.

~~~
Connection -> Closed<>
~~~

Abort terminates a Connection without delivering any remaining Messages. This action does
not affect any other Connection that in the same Connection Group.

~~~
Connection.Abort()
~~~

CloseGroup gracefully terminates a Connection and any other Connections in the
same Connection Group. For example, all of the Connections in a
group might be streams of a single session for a multistreaming protocol; closing the entire
group will close the underlying session. See also {{groups}}. As with Close, any Messages
remaining to be processed on a Connection will be handled prior to closing.

~~~
Connection.CloseGroup()
~~~

AbortGroup terminates a Connection and any other Connections in the same
Connection Group without delivering any remaining Messages.

~~~
Connection.AbortGroup()
~~~

A ConnectionError informs the application that: 1) data could not be delivered to the
peer after a timeout, 
or 2) the Connection has been aborted (e.g., because the peer has called Abort).
There is no guarantee that an Abort will indeed be signaled.

~~~
Connection -> ConnectionError<reason?>
~~~


# Connection State and Ordering of Operations and Events

This interface is designed to be independent of an implementation's
concurrency model.  The details of how exactly actions are handled, and how
events are dispatched, are implementation dependent.

Each transition of connection state is associated with one of more events:

- Ready<> occurs when a Connection created with Initiate() or
  InitiateWithSend() transitions to Established state.

- ConnectionReceived<> occurs when a Connection created with Listen()
  transitions to Established state.

- RendezvousDone<> occurs when a Connection created with Rendezvous()
  transitions to Established state.

- Closed<> occurs when a Connection transitions to Closed state without error.

- InitiateError<> occurs when a Connection created with Initiate() transitions
  from Establishing state to Closed state due to an error.

- ConnectionError<> occurs when a Connection transitions to Closed state due to
  an error in all other circumstances.

The following diagram shows the possible states of a Connection and the
events that occur upon a transition from one state to another.

~~~~~~~~~~

              (*)                               (**)
Establishing -----> Established -----> Closing ------> Closed
     |                                                   ^
     |                                                   |
     +---------------------------------------------------+
                  InitiateError<>

(*) Ready<>, ConnectionReceived<>, RendezvousDone<>
(**) Closed<>, ConnectionError<>

~~~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-connstates title="Connection State Diagram"}

<!-- vimsyntaxhlfix* -->

The interface provides the following guarantees about the ordering of
 operations:

- Sent<> events will occur on a Connection in the order in which the Messages
  were sent (i.e., delivered to the kernel or to the network interface,
  depending on implementation).

- Received<> will never occur on a Connection before it is Established; i.e.
  before a Ready<> event on that Connection, or a ConnectionReceived<> or
  RendezvousDone<> containing that Connection.

- No events will occur on a Connection after it is Closed; i.e., after a
  Closed<> event, an InitiateError<> or ConnectionError<> will not occur on that connection. To
  ensure this ordering, Closed<> will not occur on a Connection while other
  events on the Connection are still locally outstanding (i.e., known to the
  interface and waiting to be dealt with by the application).


# IANA Considerations

RFC-EDITOR: Please remove this section before publication.

This document has no Actions for IANA.
Later versions of this document may create IANA registries for generic transport property names and transport property namespaces (see {{property-names}}).

# Privacy and Security Considerations {#privacy-security}

This document describes a generic API for interacting with a Transport Services system.
Part of this API includes configuration details for transport security protocols, as discussed
in {{security-parameters}}. It does not recommend use (or disuse) of specific
algorithms or protocols. Any API-compatible transport security protocol ought to work in a Transport Services system.
Security considerations for these protocols are discussed in the respective specifications.

The described API is used to exchange information between an application and the Transport Services system. While
it is not necessarily expected that both systems are implemented by the same authority, it is expected
that the Transport Services system implementation is either provided as a library that is selected by the application
from a trusted party, or that it is part of the operating system that the application also relies on for
other tasks.

In either case, the Transport Services API is an internal interface that is used to change information locally between two systems.
However, as the Transport Services system is responsible for network communication, it is in the position to
potentially share any information provided by the application with the network or another communication peer. 
Most of the information provided over the Transport Services API are useful to configure and select protocols and paths
and are not necessarily privacy sensitive. Still, some information could be privacy sensitive because
it might reveal usage characteristics and habits of the user of an application. 

Of course any communication over a network reveals usage characteristics, as all
packets, as well as their timing and size, are part of the network-visible wire image {{?RFC8546}}. However,
the selection of a protocol and its configuration also impacts which information is visible, potentially in
clear text, and which other entities can access it. In most cases, information provided for protocol and path selection
should not directly translate to information that can be observed by network devices on the path. 
However, there might be specific configuration
information that is intended for path exposure, e.g., a DiffServ codepoint setting, that is either provided
directly by the application or indirectly configured for a traffic profile. 

Applications should be aware that communication attempts can lead to more than one connection establishment.
This is the case, for example, when the Transport Services system also executes name resolution, when support mechanisms such as
TURN or ICE are used to establish connectivity, if protocols or paths are raised, or if a path fails and 
fallback or re-establishment is supported in the Transport Services system.

Applications should also take care to not assume that all data received using the Transport Services API is always
complete or well-formed. Specifically, messages that are received partially {{receive-partial}} could be a source
of truncation attacks if applications do not distinguish between partial messages and complete messages.

The interface explicitly does not require the application to resolve names, though there is
a tradeoff between early and late binding of addresses to names. Early binding
allows the API implementation to reduce connection setup latency, at the cost
of potentially limited scope for alternate path discovery during Connection
establishment, as well as potential additional information leakage about
application interest when used with a resolution method (such as DNS without
TLS) which does not protect query confidentiality.

These communication activities are not different from what is used today. However, 
the goal of a Transport Services system is to support
such mechanisms as a generic service within the transport layer. This enables applications to more dynamically
benefit from innovations and new protocols in the transport, although it reduces transparency of the 
underlying communication actions to the application itself. The Transport Services API is designed such that protocol and path selection
can be limited to a small and controlled set if required by the application for functional or security purposes. Further,
Transport Services implementations should provide an interface to poll information about which protocol and path is currently in use as
well as provide logging about the communication events of each connection.

# Implementation Mapping {#implmapping}

The way the concepts from this abstract interface map into concrete APIs in a
given language on a given platform largely depends on the features and norms of
the language and the platform. Actions could be implemented as functions or
method calls, for instance, and Events could be implemented via event queues,
handler functions or classes, communicating sequential processes, or other
asynchronous calling conventions.

## Types

The basic types mentioned in {{notation}} typically have natural
correspondences in practical programming languages, perhaps constrained by
implementation-specific limitations. For example:

- An Integer can typically be represented in C by an `int` or `long`, subject
  to the underlying platform's ranges for each. To accommodate special values,
  a C function that returns a non-negative `int` on success may return -1 on
  failure. In Python, such a function might return `None` or raise an
  exception.
- In C, a Tuple may be represented as a `struct` with one member for each of
  the value types in the ordered grouping. In Python, by contrast, a Tuple may
  be represented natively as a `tuple`, a sequence of dynamically-typed
  elements.
- A Collection may be represented as a `std::set` in C++ or as a `set` in
  Python. In C, it may be represented as an array or as a higher-level data
  structure with appropriate accessors defined.
  
The objects described in {{notation}} can similarly be represented in
different ways depending on which programming language is used. Objects
like Preconnections, Connections, and Listeners can be long-lived, and
benefit from using object-oriented constructs. Note that in C, these
objects may need to provide a way to release or free their underlying
memory when the application is done using them. For example, since a
Preconnection can be used to initiate multiple Connections, it is the
responsibility of the application to clean up the Preconnection memory
if necessary.

## Events and Errors

This specification treats Events and Errors similarly. Errors, just as any
other Events, may occur asynchronously in network applications. However,
implementations of this interface may report Errors synchronously,
according to the error handling idioms of the implementation
platform, where they can be immediately detected, such as by generating an
exception when attempting to initiate a connection with inconsistent
Transport Properties. An error can provide an optional reason to the
application with further details about why the error occurred.

## Time Duration

Time duration types are implementation-specific.
For instance, it could be a number of seconds, number of milliseconds, or a `struct timeval` in C or a user-defined `Duration` class in C++.

# Convenience Functions

## Adding Preference Properties {#preference-conv}

As Selection Properties of type `Preference` will be set on a TransportProperties object quite frequently, implementations should provide special actions for adding each preference level i.e, `TransportProperties.Set(some_property, avoid)` is equivalent to `TransportProperties.Avoid(some_property)`:

~~~
TransportProperties.Require(property)
TransportProperties.Prefer(property)
TransportProperties.Ignore(property)

## Transport Property Profiles {#property-profiles}

To ease the use of the interface specified by this document, implementations
should provide a mechanism to create Transport Property objects (see {{selection-props}}) that are pre-configured with frequently used sets of properties.
Implementations should at least offer short-hands to specify the following property profiles:

### reliableInorderStream

This profile provides reliable, in-order transport service with
congestion control.
TCP is an example of a protocol that provides this service.
It should consist of the following properties:

 | Property                 | Value     |
 |:-------------------------|:----------|
 | reliability              | require   |
 | preserveOrder           | require   |
 | congestionControl       | require   |
 | preserveMsgBoundaries  | ignore    |

### reliableMessage

This profile provides message-preserving, reliable, in-order
transport service with congestion control.
SCTP is an example of a protocol that provides this service.
It should consist of the following properties:

 | Property                 | Value     |
 |:-------------------------|:----------|
 | reliability              | require   |
 | preserveOrder           | require   |
 | congestionControl       | require   |
 | preserveMsgBoundaries  | require   |

### unreliableDatagram

This profile provides a datagram transport service without any
reliability guarantee.
An example of a protocol that provides this service is UDP.
It consists of the following properties:

 | Property                 | Value     |
 |:-------------------------|:----------|
 | reliability              | ignore    |
 | preserveOrder           | ignore    |
 | congestionControl       | ignore    |
 | preserveMsgBoundaries  | require   |
 | safely replayable        | true      |

Applications that choose this Transport Property Profile for latency reasons
should also consider setting an appropriate Capacity Profile Property,
see {{prop-cap-profile}} and could benefit from controlling checksum
coverage, see {{prop-checksum-control-send}} and {{prop-checksum-control-receive}}.


# Relationship to the Minimal Set of Transport Services for End Systems

{{?RFC8923}} identifies a minimal set of Transport Services that end systems should offer. These services make all non-security-related transport features of TCP, MPTCP, UDP, UDP-Lite, SCTP, and LEDBAT available that (1) require interaction with the application, and (2) do not get in the way of a possible implementation over TCP (or, with limitations, UDP). The following text explains how this minimal set is reflected in the present API. For brevity, it is based on the list in Section 4.1 of {{?RFC8923}}, updated according to the discussion in Section 5 of {{?RFC8923}}. The present API covers all elements of this section except `Notification of Excessive Retransmissions (early warning below abortion threshold)`.
This list is a subset of the transport features in Appendix A of {{?RFC8923}}, which refers to the primitives in "pass 2" (Section 4) of {{!RFC8303}} for further details on the implementation with TCP, MPTCP, UDP, UDP-Lite, SCTP and LEDBAT.

* Connect:
`Initiate` Action ({{initiate}}).

* Listen:
`Listen` Action ({{listen}}).

* Specify number of attempts and/or timeout for the first establishment message:
`timeout` parameter of `Initiate` ({{initiate}}) or `InitiateWithSend` Action ({{initiate-and-send}}).

* Disable MPTCP:
`Multipath Transport` Property ({{multipath-mode}}).

* Hand over a message to reliably transfer (possibly multiple times) before connection establishment:
`InitiateWithSend` Action ({{initiate-and-send}}).

* Change timeout for aborting connection (using retransmit limit or time value):
`Timeout for Aborting Connection` property, using a time value ({{connTimeout}}).

* Timeout event when data could not be delivered for too long:
`ConnectionError` Event ({{termination}}).

* Suggest timeout to the peer:
`TCP-specific Properties: User Timeout Option (UTO)` ({{tcp-uto}}).

* Notification of ICMP error message arrival:
`Notification of ICMP soft error message arrival` property ({{prop-soft-error}}).

* Choose a scheduler to operate between streams of an association:
`Connection Group Transmission Scheduler` property ({{connScheduler}}).

* Configure priority or weight for a scheduler:
`Connection Priority` property ({{conn-priority}}).

* "Specify checksum coverage used by the sender" and "Disable checksum when sending":
`Sending Corruption Protection Length` property ({{msg-checksum}}) and `Full Checksum Coverage on Sending` property ({{prop-checksum-control-send}}).

* "Specify minimum checksum coverage required by receiver" and "Disable checksum requirement when receiving":
`Required Minimum Corruption Protection Coverage for Receiving` property ({{conn-recv-checksum}}) and `Full Checksum Coverage on Receiving` property ({{prop-checksum-control-receive}}).

* "Specify DF field":
`No Network-Layer Fragmentation` property ({{send-singular}}).

* Get max. transport-message size that may be sent using a non-fragmented IP packet from the configured interface:
`Maximum Message Size Before Fragmentation or Segmentation` property ({{conn-max-msg-notfrag}}).

* Get max. transport-message size that may be received from the configured interface:
`Maximum Message Size on Receive` property ({{conn-max-msg-recv}}).

* Obtain ECN field:
`UDP(-Lite)-specific Property: ECN` is a read-only Message Property of the MessageContext object ({{receive-ecn}}).

* "Specify DSCP field", "Disable Nagle algorithm", "Enable and configure a `Low Extra Delay Background Transfer`":
as suggested in Section 5.5 of {{?RFC8923}}, these transport features are collectively offered via the `Capacity Profile` property ({{prop-cap-profile}}). Per-Message control ("Request not to bundle messages") is offered via the `Message Capacity Profile Override` property ({{send-profile}}).

* Close after reliably delivering all remaining data, causing an event informing the application on the other side:
this is offered by the `Close` Action with slightly changed semantics in line with the discussion in Section 5.2 of {{?RFC8923}} ({{termination}}).

* "Abort without delivering remaining data, causing an event informing the application on the other side" and "Abort without delivering remaining data, not causing an event informing the application on the other side":
this is offered by the `Abort` action without promising that this is signaled to the other side. If it is, a `ConnectionError` Event will fire at the peer ({{termination}}).

* "Reliably transfer data, with congestion control", "Reliably transfer a message, with congestion control" and "Unreliably transfer a message":
data is transferred via the `Send` action ({{sending}}). Reliability is controlled via the `Reliable Data Transfer (Connection)` ({{prop-reliable}}) property and the `Reliable Data Transfer (Message)` Message Property ({{msg-reliable-message}}). Transmitting data as a message or without delimiters is controlled via Message Framers ({{framing}}). The choice of congestion control is provided via the `Congestion control` property ({{prop-cc}}).

* Configurable Message Reliability:
the `Lifetime` Message Property implements a time-based way to configure message reliability ({{msgLifetime}}).

* "Ordered message delivery (potentially slower than unordered)" and "Unordered message delivery (potentially faster than ordered)":
these two transport features are controlled via the Message Property `Ordered` ({{msgOrdered}}).

* Request not to delay the acknowledgement (SACK) of a message:
should the protocol support it, this is one of the transport features the Transport Services system can apply when an application uses the `Capacity Profile` Property ({{prop-cap-profile}}) or the `Message Capacity Profile Override` Message Property ({{send-profile}}) with value `Low Latency/Interactive`.

* Receive data (with no message delimiting):
`Receive` Action ({{receiving}}) and `Received` Event ({{receive-complete}}).

* Receive a message:
`Receive` Action ({{receiving}}) and `Received` Event ({{receive-complete}}), using Message Framers ({{framing}}).

* Information about partial message arrival:
`Receive` Action ({{receiving}}) and `ReceivedPartial` Event ({{receive-partial}}).

* Notification of send failures:
`Expired` Event ({{expired}}) and `SendError` Event ({{send-error}}).

* Notification that the stack has no more user data to send:
applications can obtain this information via the `Sent` Event ({{sent}}).

* Notification to a receiver that a partial message delivery has been aborted:
`ReceiveError` Event ({{receive-error}}).
