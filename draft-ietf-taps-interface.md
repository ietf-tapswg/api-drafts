--- abstract

This document describes an abstract programming interface to the transport
layer, following the Transport Services Architecture. It supports the
asynchronous, atomic transmission of messages over transport protocols and
network paths dynamically selected at runtime. It is intended to replace the
traditional BSD sockets API as the lowest common denominator interface to the
transport layer, in an environment where endpoints have multiple interfaces
and potential transport protocols to select from.

# Introduction

The BSD Unix Sockets API's SOCK_STREAM abstraction, by bringing network
sockets into the UNIX programming model, allowing anyone who knew how to write
programs that dealt with sequential-access files to also write network
applications, was a revolution in simplicity. The simplicity of this API is a
key reason the Internet won the protocol wars of the 1980s. SOCK_STREAM is
tied to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), specified in 1981
{{?RFC0793}}. TCP has scaled remarkably well over the past three and a half
decades, but its total ubiquity has hidden an uncomfortable fact: the network
is not really a file, and stream abstractions are too simplistic for many
modern application programming models.

In the meantime, the nature of Internet access, and the variety of Internet
transport protocols, is evolving. The challenges that new protocols and access
paradigms present to the sockets API and to programming models based on them
inspire the design principles of a new approach, which we outline in {{principles}}.

As a first step to realizing this design, {{I-D.ietf-taps-arch}}
describes a high-level architecture for transport services. This document
builds a modern abstract programming interface atop this architecture,
deriving specific path and protocol selection properties and supported
transport features from the analysis provided in {{?RFC8095}} and
{{I-D.ietf-taps-minset}}.

# Terminology and Notation

This API is described in terms of Objects, which an application can interact
with; Actions the application can perform on these Objects; Events, which an
Object can send to an application asynchronously; and Parameters associated
with these Actions and Events.

The following notations, which can be combined, are used in this document:

- An Action creates an Object:

~~~
Object := Action()
~~~

- An Action is performed on an Object:

~~~
Object.Action()
~~~

- An Object sends an Event:

~~~
Object -> Event<>
~~~

- An Action takes a set of Parameters; an Event contains a set of Parameters:

~~~
Action(parameter, parameter, ...) / Event<parameter, parameter, ...>
~~~

Actions associated with no Object are Actions on the abstract interface
itself; they are equivalent to Actions on a per-application global context.

How these abstract concepts map into concrete implementations of this API in a
given language on a given platform is largely dependent on the features of the
language and the platform. Actions could be implemented as functions or method
calls, for instance, and Events could be implemented via callback passing or
other asynchronous calling conventions. The method for registering callbacks
and handlers is left as an implementation detail, with the caveat that the
interface for receiving Messages must require the application to invoke the
Connection.Receive() Action once per Message to be received (see
{{receiving}}).

This specification treats Events and errors similarly. Errors, just as any
other Events, may occur asynchronously in network applications. However, it is
recommended that implementations of this interface also return errors
immediately, according to the error handling idioms of the implementation
platform, for errors which can be immediately detected, such as inconsistency
in transport parameters.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Interface Design Principles {#principles}

The design of the interface specified in this document is based on a set of
princples, themselves an elaboration on the architectural design principles
defined in {{I-D.ietf-taps-arch}}. The interface defined in this document
provides:

- A single interface to a variety of transport protocols to be
  used in a variety of application design patterns, independent of the
  properties of the application and the Protocol Stacks that will be used at
  runtime, such that  all common specialized features of these protocol
  stacks are made available to the application as necessary in a
  transport-independent way, to enable applications written to a single API
  to make use of transport protocols in terms of the features they provide;

- Explicit support for security properties as first-order
  transport features, and for long-term caching of cryptographic identities and
  parameters for associations among endpoints;

- Asynchronous Connection establishment,
  transmission, and reception, allowing most application interactions with the
  transport layer to be Event-driven, in line with developments in modern
  platforms and programming languages;

- Explicit support for multistreaming and multipath transport protocols, and
  the grouping of related Connections into Connection Groups through cloning
  of Connections, to allow applications to take full advantage of new
  transport protocols supporting these features; and

- Atomic transmission of data, using application-assisted framing and deframing
  where the underlying transport does not provide these.


# API Summary

The Transport Services Interface is the basic common abstract application
programming interface to the Transport Services Architecture defined in
{{I-D.ietf-taps-arch}}. An application primarily interacts with this interface through
two Objects, Preconnections and Connections. A Preconnection represents a set of
parameters and constraints on the selection and configuration of paths and
protocols to establish a Connection with a remote endpoint. A Connection
represents a transport Protocol Stack on which data can be sent to and received
from a remote endpoint. Connections can be created from Preconnections in three
ways: by initiating the Preconnection (i.e., actively opening, as in a client),
through listening on the Preconnection (i.e., passively opening, as in a
server), or rendezvousing on the Preconnection (i.e. peer to peer establishment).

Once a Connection is established, data can be sent on it in the form of
Messages. The interface supports the preservation of message boundaries both via
explicit Protocol Stack support, and via application support through a deframing
callback which finds message boundaries in a stream. Messages are received
asynchronously through a callback registered by the application. Errors and other notifications also happen asynchronously on the Connection.

In the following sections, we describe the details of application interaction
with Objects through Actions and Events in each phase of a Connection, following
the phases described in {{I-D.ietf-taps-arch}}.

# Pre-Establishment Phase

The pre-establishment phase allows applications to specify parameters for
the Connections they're about to make, or to query the API about potential
connections they could make.

A Preconnection Object represents a potential Connection. It has state that
describes parameters of a Connection that might exist in the future.  This
state comprises Local Endpoint and Remote Endpoint Objects that denote the
endpoints of the potential Connection (see {{endpointspec}}), the transport
parameters (see {{transport-params}}), and the security parameters (see
{{security-parameters}}):

~~~
   Preconnection := NewPreconnection(LocalEndpoint,
                                     RemoteEndpoint,
                                     TransportParams,
                                     SecurityParams)
~~~

The Local Endpoint MUST be specified if the Preconnection is used to Listen()
for incoming Connections, but is OPTIONAL if it is used to Initiate()
connections. The Remote Endpoint MUST be specified in the Preconnection is used
to Initiate() Connections, but is OPTIONAL if it is used to Listen() for
incoming Connections.
The Local Endpoint and the Remote Endpoint MUST both be specified if a
peer-to-peer Rendezvous is to occur based on the Preconnection.

Framers (see {{send-framing}}) and deframers (see {{receive-framing}}), if
necessary, should be bound to the Preconnection during pre-establishment.

## Specifying Endpoints {#endpointspec}

The transport services API uses the Local Endpoint and Remote Endpoint types
to refer to the endpoints of a transport connection.
Subtypes of these represent various different types of endpoint identifiers,
such as IP addresses, DNS names, and interface names, as well as port numbers
and service names.

~~~
RemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()
RemoteSpecifier.WithHostname("example.com")
RemoteSpecifier.WithService("https")
~~~

~~~
RemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()
RemoteSpecifier.WithIPv6Address(2001:db8:4920:e29d:a420:7461:7073:0a)
RemoteSpecifier.WithPort(443)
~~~

~~~
RemoteSpecifier := NewRemoteEndpoint()
RemoteSpecifier.WithIPv4Address(192.0.2.21)
RemoteSpecifier.WithPort(443)
~~~

~~~
LocalSpecifier := NewLocalEndpoint()
LocalSpecifier.WithInterface("en0")
LocalSpecifier.WithPort(443)
~~~

~~~
LocalSpecifier := NewLocalEndpoint()
LocalSpecifier.WithStunServer(address, port, credentials)
~~~

Implementations may also support additional endpoint representations and
provide a single NewEndpoint() call that takes different endpoint representations.

Multiple endpoint identifiers can be specified for each Local Endpoint and
RemoteEndoint.  For example, a Local Endpoint could be configured with two
interface names, or a Remote Endpoint could be specified via both IPv4 and
IPv6 addresses. These multiple identifiers refer to the same transport
endpoint.

The transport services API will resolve names internally, when the Initiate(),
Listen(), or Rendezvous() method is called establish a Connection.
The API does not need the application to resolve names, and premature name
resolution can damage performance by limiting the scope for alternate path
discovery during Connection establishment.
The Resolve() method is, however, provided to resolve a Local Endpoint or a
Remote Endpoint in cases where this is required, for example with some NAT
traversal protocols (see {{rendezvous}}).

## Specifying Transport Parameters {#transport-params}

A Preconnection Object holds parameters reflecting the application's
requirements and preferences for the transport. These include protocol and path
selection parameters, as well as Generic and Specific Protocol Properties for
configuration of the detailed operation of the selected Protocol Stacks.

All Transport Parameters are organized within a single namespace shared with
Send Parameters (see {{send-params}}). These transport parameters take
values of parameter-specific types.

Note that it is possible for a set of specified transport parameters to be
internally inconsistent, or to be inconsistent with the later use of the API by the application. Application developers can reduce
inconsistency by only using the most stringent preference levels when failure
to meet a preference would break the application's functionality (e.g. the
Reliable Data Transfer preference, which is a core assumption of many
application protocols). Implementations of this interface should also raise
any detected errors in configuration as early as possible, to help ensure
these inconsistencies are caught early in the development process.

The protocol(s) and path(s) selected as candidates during Connection
establishment are determined by a set of properties. Since there could be
paths over which some transport protocols are unable to operate, or remote
endpoints that support only specific network addresses or transports,
transport protocol selection is necessarily tied to path selection. This may
involve choosing between multiple local interfaces that are connected to
different access networks.

The type of most  Protocol and Path Selection properties is "preference" and has
five different preference levels:

   | Preference | Effect                                                             |
   |------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Require    | Select only protocols/paths providing the property, fail otherwise |
   | Prefer     | Prefer protocols/paths providing the property, proceed otherwise   |
   | Ignore     | Cancel any default preference for this property                    |
   | Avoid      | Prefer protocols/paths not providing the property, proceed otherwise |
   | Prohibit   | Select only protocols/paths not providing the property, fail otherwise |

Internally, the transport system will first exclude all protocols and paths
that match a Prohibit, then only keep candidates that match a Require, then
sort candidates according to Preferred properties, and then use Avoided
properties as a tiebreaker.
In case of conflicts between protocol and path selection properties,
path selection properties take precedence.
For example, if an application indicates a preference for a specific path, but
also a preference for a protocol not available on this path, the transport
system will try the path first, so the protocol selection property might not
have an effect.

An implementation of this interface must provide sensible defaults for protocol
and path selection properties. The defaults given for each property below
represent a configuration that can be implemented over TCP. An alternate set of
default Protocol Selection Properties would represent a configuration that can
be implemented over UDP.

All transport parameters used in the pre-establishment phase are collected
in a TransportParameters Object that is passed to the Preconnection Object.

~~~
TransportParameters := NewTransportParameters()
~~~

The Individual parameters are then added to the TransportParameters Object.
While Protocol Properties use the `add` call, Transport Preferences use
special calls for the levels defined in {{transport-params}}.

~~~
TransportParameters.Add(parameter, value)

TransportParameters.Require(preference)
TransportParameters.Prefer(preference)
TransportParameters.Ignore(preference)
TransportParameters.Avoid(preference)
TransportParameters.Prohibit(preference)
~~~

For an existing Connection, the Transport Parameters can be queried any time
by using the following call on the Connection Object:

~~~
TransportParameters := Connection.GetTransportParameters()
~~~

Note that most properties are only considered for Connection establishment and
can not be changed after a Connection is established; however, they can be
queried. See {{introspection}}.

A Connection gets its Transport Parameters either by being explicitly configured
via a Preconnection, or by inheriting them from an antecedent via cloning; see
{{groups}} for more.

In addition to protocol and path selection properties, the transport parameters
may also contain Generic and/or Specific Protocol Properties (see
{{protocol-props}}). These properties will be passed to the selected candidate
Protocol Stack(s) to configure them before candidate Connection establishment.

The following properties can be used during Protocol and Path selection:

### Reliable Data Transfer {#prop-reliable}

Type: Preference

This property specifies whether the application wishes to use a
transport protocol that that provides mechanisms to help ensure that all data
is received and without corruption on the other side. This also entails being
notified when a Connection is closed or aborted. This property applies to
Connections and Connection Groups.  This is a strict requirement. The default
is to enable Reliable Data Transfer.

### Preservation of data ordering {#prop-ordering}

Type: Preference

This property specifies whether the application wishes to use a
transport protocol that provides mechanisms to ensure that data is received
by the application on the other end in the same order as it was sent. This
property applies to Connections and Connection Groups. This is a strict
requirement. The default is to preserve data ordering.

### Configure reliability on a per-Message basis {#prop-partially-reliable}

Type: Preference

This property specifies whether an application considers it
useful to indicate its reliability requirements on a per-Message basis.
This property applies to Connections and Connection Groups. This is not a
strict requirement.  The default is to not have this option.

### Use 0-RTT session establishment with an idempotent Message {#prop-0rtt}

Type: Preference

This property specifies whether an application would like to
supply a Message to the transport protocol before Connection
establishment, which will then be reliably transferred to the other side
before or during Connection establishment, potentially multiple times.
See also {{send-idempotent}}.  This is a strict requirement. The default
is to not have this option.

### Multistream Connections in Group {#prop-multistream}

Type: Preference

This property specifies that the application would prefer multiple
Connections within a Connection Group to be provided by streams of a single
underlying transport connection where possible. This is not a strict
requirement. The default is to not have this option.

### Notification of excessive retransmissions {#prop-retrans-notify}

Type: Boolean

This property specifies whether an application considers it useful to be informed in case sent data was retransmitted more often than a certain threshold.
When set to true, the effect is twofold:
The application may receive events in case excessive retransmissions.
In addition, the transport system considers this as a preference to use transports stacks that can provide this notification. This is not a strict requirement.
If set to false, no notification of excessive retransmissions will be sent and this transport feature is ignored for protocol selection.

This property applies to Connections and Connection Groups.
The default is to have this option.

### Notification of ICMP soft error message arrival {#prop-soft-error}

Type: Boolean

This property specifies whether an application considers it useful
to be informed when an ICMP error message arrives that does not force
termination of a connection.
When set to true, received ICMP errors will be available as SoftErrors.
Note that even if a protocol supporting this property is selected, not all
ICMP errors will necessarily be delivered, so applications cannot rely
on receiving them.
Setting this option also implies a preference to prefer transports stacks that can provide this notification.
If not set, no events will be sent for ICMP soft error message and this transport feature is ignored for protocol selection.

This property applies to Connections and Connection Groups.
The default is not to have this option.

### Control checksum coverage on sending or receiving {#prop-checksum-control}

Type: Preference

This property specifies whether the application considers it
useful to enable / disable / configure a checksum when sending data,
or decide whether to require a checksum or not when receiving data.
This property applies to Connections and Connection Groups. This is not a
strict requirement, as it signifies a reduction in reliability. The
default is full checksum coverage without being able to change it, and
requiring a checksum when receiving.

### Interface Type {#prop-intf-type}

Type: Tuple (Enumeration, Preference)

This property specifies which kind of access network interface,
e.g., WiFi, Ethernet, or LTE, to prefer over others for this Connection, in
case they are available. In general, Interface Types should be used only with
the `Prefer` and `Prohibit` preference level. Specifically, using the
`Require` preference level for Interface Type may limit path selection in a
way that is detrimental to connectivity. The default is to use the default
interface configured in the system policy.
The valid values for the access network interface kinds are implementation specific.

### Capacity Profile {#prop-cap-profile}

Type: Enumeration

This property specifies the application's expectation of the dominating traffic pattern for this Connection.
This implies that the transport system should optimize for the capacity profile specified. This can influence path and protocol selection.
The following values are valid for Capacity Profile:

  Default:
  : The application makes no representation about its expected
  capacity profile. No special optimizations of the tradeoff between
  delay, delay variation, and bandwidth efficiency should be made when selecting and
  configuring stacks.

  Low Latency:
  : Response time (latency) should be optimized at
  the expense of bandwidth efficiency and delay variation when sending this
  message. This can be used by the system to disable the coalescing of
  multiple small Messages into larger packets (Nagle's algorithm); to prefer
  immediate acknowledgment from the peer endpoint when supported by the
  underlying transport; to signal a preference for lower-latency, higher-loss
  treatment; and so on.

  Constant Rate:
  : The application expects to send/receive data at a constant rate after
  Connection establishment. Delay and delay variation should be minimized at the
  expense of bandwidth efficiency. This implies that the Connection may fail
  if the desired rate cannot be maintained across the Path. A transport
  may interpret this capacity profile as preferring a circuit breaker
  {{?RFC8084}} to a rate adaptive congestion controller.

  Scavenger/Bulk:
  : The application is not interactive. It expects to send/receive a large
  amount of data, without any urgency. This can be used to select protocol
  stacks with scavenger transmission control, to signal a preference for
  less-than-best-effort treatment, and so on.

## Specifying Security Parameters and Callbacks {#security-parameters}

Common parameters such as TLS ciphersuites are known to implementations. Clients SHOULD
use common safe defaults for these values whenever possible. However, as discussed in
{{I-D.ietf-taps-transport-security}}, many transport security protocols require specific
security parameters and constraints from the client at the time of configuration and
actively during a handshake. These configuration parameters are created as follows

~~~
SecurityParameters := NewSecurityParameters()
~~~

Security configuration parameters and sample usage follow:

- Local identity and private keys: Used to perform private key operations and prove one's
identity to the Remote Endpoint. (Note, if private keys are not available, e.g., since they are
stored in HSMs, handshake callbacks MUST be used. See below for details.)

~~~
SecurityParameters.AddIdentity(identity)
SecurityParameters.AddPrivateKey(privateKey, publicKey)
~~~

- Supported algorithms: Used to restrict what parameters are used by underlying transport security protocols.
When not specified, these algorithms SHOULD default to known and safe defaults for the system. Parameters include:
ciphersuites, supported groups, and signature algorithms.

~~~
SecurityParameters.AddSupportedGroup(22)    // secp256k1
SecurityParameters.AddCiphersuite(0xCCA9)   // TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
SecurityParameters.AddSignatureAlgorithm(7) // ed25519
~~~

- Session cache: Used to tune cache capacity, lifetime, re-use,
and eviction policies, e.g., LRU or FIFO.

~~~
SecurityParameters.SetSessionCacheCapacity(1024)     // 1024 elements
SecurityParameters.SetSessionCacheLifetime(24*60*60) // 24 hours
SecurityParameters.SetSessionCacheReuse(1)           // One-time use
~~~

- Pre-shared keying material: Used to install pre-shared keying material established
out-of-band. Each pre-shared keying material is associated with some identity that typically identifies
its use or has some protocol-specific meaning to the Remote Endpoint.

~~~
SecurityParameters.AddPreSharedKey(key, identity)
~~~

Security decisions, especially pertaining to trust, are not static. Thus, once configured,
parameters must also be supplied during live handshakes. These are best handled as
client-provided callbacks. Security handshake callbacks include:

- Trust verification callback: Invoked when a Remote Endpoint's trust must be validated before the
handshake protocol can proceed.

~~~
TrustCallback := NewCallback({
  // Handle trust, return the result
})
SecurityParameters.SetTrustVerificationCallback(trustCallback)
~~~

- Identity challenge callback: Invoked when a private key operation is required, e.g., when
local authentication is requested by a remote.

~~~
ChallengeCallback := NewCallback({
  // Handle challenge
})
SecurityParameters.SetIdentityChallengeCallback(challengeCallback)
~~~

Like transport parameters, security parameters are inherited during cloning (see
{{groups}}).

# Establishing Connections

Before a Connection can be used for data transfer, it must be established.
Establishment ends the pre-establishment phase; all transport and
cryptographic parameter specification must be complete before establishment,
as these parameters will be used to select candidate Paths and Protocol Stacks
for the Connection. Establishment may be active, using the Initiate() Action;
passive, using the Listen() Action; or simultaneous for peer-to-peer, using
the Rendezvous() Action. These Actions are described in the subsections below.

## Active Open: Initiate {#initiate}

Active open is the Action of establishing a Connection to a Remote Endpoint presumed
to be listening for incoming Connection requests. Active open is used by clients in
client-server interactions. Active open is supported by this interface through the
Initiate Action:

~~~
Connection := Preconnection.Initiate()
~~~

Before calling Initiate, the caller must have populated a Preconnection
Object with a Remote Endpoint specifier, optionally a Local Endpoint
specifier (if not specified, the system will attempt to determine a
suitable Local Endpoint), as well as all parameters
necessary for candidate selection. After calling Initiate, no further
parameters may be bound to the Connection. The Initiate() call consumes
the Preconnection and creates a Connection Object. A Preconnection can
only be initiated once.

Once Initiate is called, the candidate Protocol Stack(s) may cause one or more
candidate transport-layer connections to be created to the specified remote
endpoint. The caller may immediately begin sending Messages on the Connection
(see {{sending}}) after calling Initate(); note that any idempotent data sent
while the Connection is being established may be sent multiple times or on
multiple candidates.

The following Events may be sent by the Connection after Initiate() is called:

~~~
Connection -> Ready<>
~~~

The Ready Event occurs after Initiate has established a transport-layer
connection on at least one usable candidate Protocol Stack over at least one
candidate Path. No Receive Events (see {{receiving}}) will occur before
the Ready Event for Connections established using Initiate.

~~~
Connection -> InitiateError<>
~~~

An InitiateError occurs either when the set of transport and cryptographic
parameters cannot be fulfilled on a Connection for initiation (e.g. the set of
available Paths and/or Protocol Stacks meeting the constraints is empty) or
reconciled with the local and/or remote endpoints; when the remote specifier
cannot be resolved; or when no transport-layer connection can be established
to the remote endpoint (e.g. because the remote endpoint is not accepting
connections, or the application is prohibited from opening a Connection by the
operating system).

## Passive Open: Listen {#listen}

Passive open is the Action of waiting for Connections from remote endpoints,
commonly used by servers in client-server interactions. Passive open is
supported by this interface through the Listen Action:

~~~
Preconnection.Listen()
~~~

Before calling Listen, the caller must have initialized the Preconnection
during the pre-establishment phase with a Local Endpoint specifier, as well
as all parameters necessary for Protocol Stack selection. A Remote Endpoint
may optionally be specified, to constrain what Connections are accepted.
The Listen() Action consumes the Preconnection. Once Listen() has been
called, no further parameters may be bound to the Preconnection, and no
subsequent establishment call may be made on the Preconnection.

~~~
Preconnection -> ConnectionReceived<Connection>
~~~

The ConnectionReceived Event occurs when a Remote Endpoint has established a
transport-layer connection to this Preconnection (for Connection-oriented
transport protocols), or when the first Message has been received from the
Remote Endpoint (for Connectionless protocols), causing a new Connection to be
created. The resulting Connection is contained within the ConnectionReceived
event, and is ready to use as soon as it is passed to the application via the
event.

~~~
Preconnection -> ListenError<>
~~~

A ListenError occurs either when the Preconnection cannot be fulfilled for
listening, when the Local Endpoint (or Remote Endpoint, if specified) cannot
be resolved, or when the application is prohibited from listening by policy.

## Peer-to-Peer Establishment: Rendezvous {#rendezvous}

Simultaneous peer-to-peer Connection establishment is supported by the
Rendezvous() Action:

~~~
Preconnection.Rendezvous()
~~~

The Preconnection Object must be specified with both a Local Endpoint and a
Remote Endpoint, and also the transport and security parameters needed for
Protocol Stack selection. The Rendezvous() Action causes the Preconnection
to listen on the Local Endpoint for an incoming Connection from the
Remote Endpoint, while simultaneously trying to establish a Connection from
the Local Endpoint to the Remote Endpoint.
This corresponds to a TCP simultaneous open, for example.

The Rendezvous() Action consumes the Preconnection. Once Rendezvous() has
been called, no further parameters may be bound to the Preconnection, and
no subsequent establishment call may be made on the Preconnection.

~~~
Preconnection -> RendezvousDone<Connection>
~~~

The RendezvousDone<> Event occurs when a Connection is established with the
Remote Endpoint. For Connection-oriented transports, this occurs when the
transport-layer connection is established; for Connectionless transports,
it occurs when the first Message is received from the Remote Endpoint. The
resulting Connection is contained within the RendezvousDone<> Event, and is
ready to use as soon as it is passed to the application via the Event.

~~~
Preconnection -> RendezvousError<msgRef, error>
~~~

An RendezvousError occurs either when the Preconnection cannot be fulfilled
for listening, when the Local Endpoint or Remote Endpoint cannot be resolved,
when no transport-layer connection can be established to the Remote Endpoint,
or when the application is prohibited from rendezvous by policy.

When using some NAT traversal protocols, e.g., ICE {{?RFC5245}}, it is
expected that the Local Endpoint will be configured with some method of
discovering NAT bindings, e.g., a STUN server. In this case, the
Local Endpoint may resolve to a mixture of local and server reflexive
addresses. The Resolve() method on the Preconnection can be used to
discover these bindings:

~~~
PreconnectionBindings := Preconnection.Resolve()
~~~

The Resolve() call returns a list of Preconnection Objects, that represent
the concrete addresses, local and server reflexive, on which a Rendezvous()
for the Preconnection will listen for incoming Connections. This list can
be passed to a peer via a signalling protocol, such as SIP or WebRTC, to
configure the remote.

## Connection Groups {#groups}

Groups of Connections can be created using the Clone Action:

~~~
Connection := Connection.Clone()
~~~

Calling Clone on a Connection yields a group of two Connections: the parent
Connection on which Clone was called, and the resulting clone Connection. These
connections are "entangled" with each other, and become part of a Connection
group. Calling Clone on any of these two Connections adds a third Connection to
the group, and so on. Connections in a Connection Group share all their
properties, and changing the properties on one Connection in the group changes
the property for all others.

If the underlying Protocol Stack does not support cloning, or cannot create a
new stream on the given Connection, then attempts to clone a connection will
result in a CloneError:

~~~
Connection -> CloneError<>
~~~

There is only one Protocol Property that is not entangled: niceness is kept as
a separate per-Connection Property for individual Connections in the group.
Niceness works as in {{send-niceness}}: when allocating available network
capacity among Connections in a Connection Group, sends on Connections with
higher Niceness values will be prioritized over sends on Connections with
lower Niceness values. An ideal transport system implementation would assign
the Connection the capacity share (M-N) x C / M, where N is the Connection's
Niceness value, M is the maximum Niceness value used by all Connections in the
group and C is the total available capacity. However, the niceness setting is
purely advisory, and no guarantees are given about capacity allocation and
each implementation is free to implement exact capacity allocation as it sees
fit.

# Sending Data {#sending}

Once a Connection has been established, it can be used for sending data. Data
is sent by passing a Message Object and additional parameters
{{send-params}} to the Send Action on an established Connection:

~~~
Connection.Send(Message, sendParameters)
~~~

The type of the Message to be passed is dependent on the implementation, and
on the constraints on the Protocol Stacks implied by the Connection's
transport parameters. It may itself contain an array of octets to be
transmitted in the transport protocol payload, or be transformable to an array
of octets by a sender-side framer (see {{send-framing}}).

Some transport protocols can deliver arbitrarily sized Messages, but other
protocols constrain the maximum Message size. Applications can query the
protocol property Maximum Message Size on Send to determine the maximum size.

There may also be system and Protocol Stack dependent limits on the size of
a Message which can be transmitted atomically. For that reason, the Message
object passed to the Send action may also be a partial Message, either
representing the whole data object and information about the range of bytes
to send from it, or an object referring back to the larger whole Message.
The details of partial Message sending are implementation-dependent.

If Send is called on a Connection which has not yet been established, an
Initiate Action will be implicitly performed simultaneously with the Send.
Used together with the Idempotent property (see {{send-idempotent}}), this can
be used to send data during establishment for 0-RTT session resumption on
Protocol Stacks that support it.

Like all Actions in this interface, the Send Action is asynchronous.

~~~
Connection -> Sent<msgRef>
~~~

The Sent Event occurs when a previous Send Action has completed, i.e., when the
data derived from the Message has been passed down or through the underlying
Protocol Stack and is no longer the responsibility of the implementation of
this interface. The exact disposition of the Message when the Sent Event occurs is
specific to the implementation and the constraints on the Protocol Stacks
implied by the Connection's transport parameters. The Sent Event contains an
implementation-specific reference to the Message to which it applies.

Sent Events allow an application to obtain an understanding of the amount
of buffering it creates. That is, if an application calls the Send Action multiple
times without waiting for a Sent Event, it has created more buffer inside the
transport system than an application that only issues a Send after this Event fires.

~~~
Connection -> Expired<msgRef>
~~~

The Expired Event occurs when a previous Send Action expired before completion;
i.e. when the Message was not sent before its Lifetime (see {{send-lifetime}})
expired. This is separate from SendError, as it is an expected behavior for
partially reliable transports. The Expired Event contains an
implementation-specific reference to the Message to which it applies.

~~~
Connection -> SendError<msgRef>
~~~

A SendError occurs when a Message could not be sent due to an error condition:
an attempt to send a Message which is too large for the system and
Protocol Stack to handle, some failure of the underlying Protocol Stack, or a
set of send parameters not consistent with the Connection's transport
parameters. The SendError contains an implementation-specific reference to the
Message to which it applies.

## Send Parameters {#send-params}

The Send Action takes per-Message send parameters which control how the
contents will be sent down to the underlying Protocol Stack and transmitted.

If Send Parameters should be overridden for a specific Message, an
empty sent parameter Object can be acquired and all desired Send Parameters
can be added to that Object. A sendParameters Object can be reused for
sending multiple contents with the same properties.

~~~
SendParameters := NewSendParameters()
SendParameters.Add(parameter, value)
~~~

The Send Parameters share a single namespace with the Transport Parameters (see
{{transport-params}}). This allows the specification of Protocol Properties that can
be overridden on a per-Message basis.

Send Parameters may be inconsistent with the properties of the Protocol Stacks
underlying the Connection on which a given Message is sent. For example,
infinite Lifetime is not possible on a Message over a Connection not providing
reliability. Sending a Message with Send Properties inconsistent with the
Transport Preferences on the Connection yields an error.

The following send parameters are supported:

### Lifetime {#send-lifetime}

Lifetime specifies how long a particular Message can wait to be sent to the
remote endpoint before it is irrelevant and no longer needs to be
(re-)transmitted. When a Message's Lifetime is infinite, it must be
transmitted reliably. The type and units of Lifetime are
implementation-specific.

### Niceness {#send-niceness}

Niceness represents an unbounded hierarchy of priorities of Messages, relative
to other Messages sent over the same Connection and/or Connection Group (see
{{groups}}). It is most naturally represented as a non-negative integer.
A Message with Niceness 0 will yield to a Message with Niceness 1, which will
yield to a Message with Niceness 2, and so on. Niceness may be used as a
sender-side scheduling construct only, or be used to specify priorities on the
wire for Protocol Stacks supporting prioritization.

Note that this inversion of normal schemes for expressing priority has a
convenient property: priority increases as both Niceness and Lifetime
decrease.

### Ordered {#send-ordered}

Ordered is a boolean property. If true, this Message should be delivered after
the last Message passed to the same Connection via the Send Action; if false,
this Message may be delivered out of order.

### Idempotent {#send-idempotent}

Idempotent is a boolean property. If true, the application-layer entity in the
Message is safe to send to the remote endpoint more than once for a single
Send Action. It is used to mark data safe for certain 0-RTT establishment
techniques, where retransmission of the 0-RTT data may cause the remote
application to receive the Message multiple times.

### Final {#send-final}

Final is a boolean property. If true, this Message is the last one that
the application will send on a Connection. This allows underlying protocols
to indicate to the Remote Endpoint that the Connection has been effectively
closed in the sending direction. For example, TCP-based Connections can
send a FIN once a Message marked as Final has been completely sent. 
Protocols that do not support signalling the end of a Connection in a given
direction will ignore this property.

Note that a Final Message must always be sorted to the end of a list of Messages.
The Final property overrides Niceness and any other property that would re-order
Messages. If another Message is sent after a Message marked as Final has already
been sent on a Connection, the new Message will report an error.

### Corruption Protection Length {#send-checksum}

This numeric property specifies the length of the section of the Message,
starting from byte 0, that the application assumes will be received without
corruption due to lower layer errors. It is used to specify options for simple
integrity protection via checksums. By default, the entire Message is protected
by checksum. A value of 0 means that no checksum is required, and a special
value (e.g. -1) can be used to indicate the default. Only full coverage is
guaranteed, any other requests are advisory.

### Transmission Profile {#send-profile}

This enumerated property specifies the application's preferred tradeoffs for
sending this Message; it is a per-Message override of the Capacity Profile
protocol and path selection property (see {{prop-cap-profile}}).

The following values are valid for Transmission Profile:

  Default:
  :  No special optimizations of the tradeoff between delay, delay
  variation, and bandwidth efficiency should be made when sending this message.

  Low Latency:
  : Response time (latency) should be optimized at
  the expense of bandwidth efficiency and delay variation when sending this
  message. This can be used by the system to disable the coalescing of
  multiple small Messages into larger packets (Nagle's algorithm); to prefer
  immediate acknowledgment from the peer endpoint when supported by the
  underlying transport; to signal a preference for lower-latency, higher-loss
  treatment; and so on.

  Constant Rate:
  : Delay and delay variation should be minimized at the
  expense of bandwidth efficiency.

  Scavenger/Bulk:
  : This Message may be sent at the system's leisure. This can
  be used to signal a preference for less-than-best-effort treatment, to delay
  sending until lower-cost paths are available, and so on.

## Batching Sends {#send-batching}

In order to reduce the overhead of sending multiple small Messages on a Connection, the
application may want to batch several Send actions together. This provides a hint to
the system that the sending of these Messages should be coalesced when possible,
and that sending any of the batched Messages may be delayed until the last Message
in the batch is enqueued.

~~~
Connection.Batch(
    Connection.Send(Message, sendParameters)
    Connection.Send(Message, sendParameters)
)
~~~

## Sender-side Framing {#send-framing}

Sender-side framing allows a caller to provide the interface with a function
that takes a Message of an appropriate application-layer type and returns an
array of octets, the on-the-wire representation of the Message to be handed down
to the Protocol Stack. It consists of a Framer Object with a single Action,
Frame. Since the Framer depends on the protocol used at the application layer,
it is bound to the Preconnection during the pre-establishment phase:

~~~
Preconnection.FrameWith(Framer)

OctetArray := Framer.Frame(Message)
~~~

Sender-side framing is a convenience feature of the interface, for parity with
receiver-side framing (see {{receive-framing}}).

# Receiving Data {#receiving}

Once a Connection is established, Messages may be received on it. The application can indicate that it is ready to receive Messages by calling Receive() on the Connection.

~~~
Connection.Receive(ReceiveHandler, maxLength)
~~~

Receive takes a ReceiveHandler, which can handle the Received Event and the
ReceiveError error. Each call to Receive will result in at most one Received
event being sent to the handler, though implementations may provide
convenience functions to indicate readiness to receive a larger but finite
number of Messages with a single call. This allows an application to provide
backpressure to the transport stack when it is temporarily not ready to
receive messages.

Receive also takes an optional maxLength argument, the maximum size (in bytes
of data) Message the application is currently prepared to receive. The default
value for maxLength is infinite. If an incoming Message is larger than the
minimum of this size and the maximum Message size on receive for
the Connection's Protocol Stack, it will be received as a partial Message.
Note that maxLength does not guarantee that the application will receive that
many bytes if they are available; the interface may return partial Messages
smaller than maxLength according to implementation constraints.

~~~
Connection -> Received<Message>
~~~

As with sending, the type of the Message to be passed is dependent on the
implementation, and on the constraints on the Protocol Stacks implied by the
Connection's transport parameters. The Message may also contain metadata from
protocols in the Protocol Stack; which metadata is available is Protocol Stack
dependent. In particular, when this information is available, the value of the
Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) field is contained in such metadata.
This information can be used for logging and debugging purposes, and for
building applications which need access to information about the transport
internals for their own operation.

The Message Object must provide some method to retrieve an octet array
containing application data, corresponding to a single message within the
underlying Protocol Stack's framing.  See {{receive-framing}} for handling
framing in situations where the Protocol Stack provides octet-stream transport
only.

The Message Object passed to Received is complete and atomic, unless one of the following
conditions holds:

* the underlying Protocol Stack supports message boundary preservation, and
  the size of the Message is larger than the buffers available for a single
  message;
* the underlying Protocol Stack does not support message boundary
  preservation, and the deframer (see {{receive-framing}}) cannot determine
  the end of the message using the buffer space it has available; or
* the underlying Protocol Stack does not support message boundary
  preservation, and no deframer was supplied by the application

The Message Object passed to Received will indicate one of the following:

1. this is a complete message;
2. this is a partial message containing a section of a message with a known message boundary (made partial for local buffering reasons, either by the underlying Protocol Stack or the deframer). In this case, the Message Object passed to Received may contain the byte offset of the data in the partial Message within the full Message, an indication whether this is the
last (highest-offset) partial Message in the full Message, and an optional
reference to the full Message it belongs to; or
3. this is a partial message containing data with no definite message boundary, i.e. the only known message boundary is given by termination of the Connection

Note that in the absence of message boundary preservation and without
deframing, the entire Connection is represented as one large message of
indeterminate length.

~~~
Connection -> ReceiveError<>
~~~

A ReceiveError occurs when data is received by the underlying Protocol Stack
that cannot be fully retrieved or deframed, or when some other indication is
received that reception has failed. Such conditions that irrevocably lead the
the termination of the Connection are signaled using ConnectionError instead
(see {{termination}}).

## Receiving Final Messages

The application may check a property to determine if a received Message is
the Final Message on a Connection. For any Message that is marked as Final,
the application can assume that there will be no more Messages received on the
Connection once the Message has been completely delivered. This corresponds
to the Final property that may be marked on a sent Message {{send-final}}.

Some transport protocols and peers may not support signaling of the Final property.
Applications therefore should not rely on receiving a Message marked Final to know
that the other endpoint is done sending on a connection.

Any calls to `Receive` once the Final Message has been delivered will result in errors.

## Receiver-side De-framing over Stream Protocols {#receive-framing}

The Receive Event is intended to be fired once per application-layer Message
sent by the remote endpoint; i.e., it is a desired property of this interface
that a Send at one end of a Connection maps to exactly one Receive on the
other end. This is possible with Protocol Stacks that provide
message boundary preservation, but is not the case over Protocol Stacks that
provide a simple octet stream transport.

For preserving message boundaries over stream transports, this interface
provides receiver-side de-framing. This facility is based on the observation
that, since many of our current application protocols evolved over TCP, which
does not provide message boundary preservation, and since many of these protocols
require message boundaries to function, each application layer protocol has
defined its own framing. A Deframer allows an application to push this
de-framing down into the interface, in order to transform an octet stream into
a sequence of Messages.

Concretely, receiver-side de-framing allows a caller to provide the interface
with a function that takes an octet stream, as provided by the underlying
Protocol Stack, reads and returns a single Message of an appropriate type for
the application and platform, and leaves the octet stream at the start of the
next Message to deframe. It consists of a Deframer Object with a single Action,
Deframe. Since the Deframer depends on the protocol used at the application
layer, it is bound to the Preconnection during the pre-establishment phase:

~~~
Preconnection.DeframeWith(Deframer)

Message := Deframer.Deframe(OctetStream, ...)
~~~

# Setting and Querying of Connection Properties {#introspection}

At any point, the application can set and query the properties of a
Connection. Depending on the phase the Connection is in, the Connection
properties will include different information.

~~~
ConnectionProperties := Connection.GetProperties()
~~~

~~~
Connection.SetProperties()
~~~

Connection properties include:

* The status of the Connection, which can be one of the following:
  Establishing, Established, Closing, or Closed.

* Transport Features of the protocols that conform to the Required and
  Prohibited Transport Preferences, which might be selected by the transport
  system during Establishment. These features correspond to the properties
  given in {{transport-params}} and can only be queried.

* Transport Features of the Protocol Stacks that were selected and
  instantiated, once the Connection has been established. These features
  correspond to the properties given in {{transport-params}} and can only be
  queried. Instead of preference levels, these features have boolean values
  indicating whether or not they were selected. Note that these transport
  features may not fully reflect the specified parameters given in the
  pre-establishment phase.  For example, a certain Protocol Selection Property
  that an application specified as Preferred may not actually be present in
  the chosen Protocol Stack Instances because none of the currently available
  transport protocols had this feature.

* Protocol Properties of the Protocol Stack in use (see {{protocol-props}}
  below). These can be set or queried. Certain specific procotol queries may
  be read-only, on a protocol- and property-specific basis.

* Path Properties of the path(s) in use, once the Connection has been
  established. These properties can be derived from the local provisioning
  domain, measurements by the Protocol Stack, or other sources. They can only
  be queried.

## Protocol Properties {#protocol-props}

Protocol Properties represent the configuration of the selected Protocol Stacks
backing a Connection. Some properties apply generically across multiple
transport protocols, while other properties only apply to specific protocols.
The default settings of these properties will vary based on the specific
protocols being used and the system's configuration.

Note that Protocol Properties are also set during pre-establishment, as
transport parameters, to preconfigure Protocol Stacks during establishment.

Generic Protocol Properties include:

* Relative niceness: This numeric property is similar to the Niceness send
  property (see {{send-niceness}}), a non-negative integer representing the
  relative inverse priority of this Connection relative to other Connections in
  the same Connection Group. It has no effect on Connections not part of a
  Connection Group. As noted in {{groups}}, this property is not entangled when
  Connections are cloned.

* Timeout for aborting Connection: This numeric property specifies how long to
  wait before aborting a Connection during establishment, or before deciding
  that a Connection has failed after establishment. It is given in seconds.

* Retransmission threshold before excessive retransmission notification:
  This numeric property specifies after how many retransmissions to inform
  the application about "Excessive Retransmissions".

* Required minimum coverage of the checksum for receiving:
  This numeric property specifies the part of the received data that needs
  to be covered by a checksum. It is given in Bytes. A value of 0 means
  that no checksum is required, and a special value (e.g., -1) indicates
  full checksum coverage.

* Connection group transmission scheduler:
  This enumerated property specifies which
  scheduler should be used among Connections within a Connection Group. It
  applies to Connection Groups; the set of schedulers can be taken from
  {{I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-ndata}}.

* Maximum message size concurrent with Connection establishment:
  This numeric property represents the maximum Message size that can be sent
  before or during Connection establishment, see also {{send-idempotent}}.
  It is given in Bytes. This property is read-only.

* Maximum Message size before fragmentation or segmentation: This numeric
  property, if applicable, represents the maximum Message size that can be
  sent without incurring network-layer fragmentation and/or transport layer
  segmentation at the sender. This property is read-only.

* Maximum Message size on send: This numeric property represents
  the maximum Message size that can be sent. This
  property is read-only.

* Maximum Message size on receive: This numeric property
  represents the maximum Message size that can be received.
  This property is read-only.

In order to specify Specific Protocol Properties, Transport System
implementations may offer applications to attach a set of options to the
Preconnection Object, associated with a specific protocol. For example, an
application could specify a set of TCP Options to use if and only if TCP is
selected by the system. Such properties must not be assumed to apply across
different protocols. Attempts to set specific protocol properties on a
Protocol Stack not containing that specific protocol are simply ignored, and
do not raise an error.

# Connection Termination {#termination}

Close terminates a Connection after satisfying all the requirements that were
specified regarding the delivery of Messages that the application has already
given to the transport system. For example, if reliable delivery was requested
for a Message handed over before calling Close, the transport system will ensure
that this Message is indeed delivered. If the Remote Endpoint still has data to
send, it cannot be received after this call.

~~~
Connection.Close()
~~~

The Closed Event can inform the application that the Remote Endpoint has closed the
Connection; however, there is no guarantee that a remote close will be
signaled.

~~~
Connection -> Closed<>
~~~

Abort terminates a Connection without delivering remaining data:

~~~
Connection.Abort()
~~~

A ConnectionError can inform the application that the other side has aborted
the Connection; however, there is no guarantee that an abort will be signaled:

~~~
Connection -> ConnectionError<>
~~~

A SoftError can inform the application about the receipt of an ICMP error
message that does not force termination of the connection, if the underlying
protocol stack supports access to soft errors; however, even if the underlying
stack supports it, there is no guarantee that a soft error will be signaled.

~~~
Connection -> SoftError<>
~~~

# Additional Properties {#appendix-non-consensus}

The interface specified by this document represents the minimal common interface
to an endpoint in the transport services architecture {{I-D.ietf-taps-arch}}, based upon
that architecture and on the minimal set of transport service features
elaborated in {{I-D.ietf-taps-minset}}. However, the interface has been designed with
extension points to allow the implementation of features beyond those in the
minimal common interface: Protocol Selection Properties, Path Selection
Properties, and options on Message send are open sets. Implementations of the
interface are free to extend these sets to provide additional expressiveness to
applications written on top of them.

This appendix enumerates a few additional parameters and properties that could
be used to enhance transport protocol and/or path selection, or the transmission
of messages given a Protocol Stack that implements them. These are not part of
the interface, and may be removed from the final document, but are presented
here to support discussion within the TAPS working group as to whether they
should be added to a future revision of the base specification.

## Protocol and Path Selection Properties

The following protocol and path selection properties might be made available in
addition to those specified in {{transport-params}}:

* Suggest a timeout to the Remote Endpoint: This boolean property specifies
  whether an application considers it useful to propose a timeout until the
  Connection is assumed to be lost. This property applies to Connections and
  Connection Groups. This is not a strict requirement. The default is to have
  this option. \[EDITOR'S NOTE: For discussion of this option, see
  https://github.com/taps-api/drafts/issues/109]

* Request not to delay acknowledgment of Message:
  This boolean property specifies whether an application considers it
  useful to request for Message that its acknowledgment be sent out as
  early as possible instead of potentially being bundled with other
  acknowledgments. This property applies to Connections and Connection
  groups. This is not a strict requirement. The default is to not have this
  option. \[EDITOR'S NOTE: For discussion of this option, see
  https://github.com/taps-api/drafts/issues/90]

### Application Intents {#intents}

Application Intents are a group of transport properties expressing what an
application wants to achieve, knows, assumes or prefers regarding its
communication. They are not strict requirements. In particular, they should not
be used to express any Quality of Service expectations that an application might
have. Instead, an application should express its intentions and its expected
traffic characteristics in order to help the transport system make decisions
that best match it, but on a best-effort basis. Even though Application Intents
do not represent Quality of Service requirements, a transport system may use
them to determine a DSCP value, e.g. similar to Table 1 in
{{I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos}}.

Application Intents can influence protocol selection, protocol configuration,
path selection, and endpoint selection. For example, setting the "Timeliness"
Intent to "Interactive" may lead the transport system to disable the Nagle
algorithm for a Connection, while setting the "Timeliness" to "Background" may
lead it to setting the DSCP value to "scavenger". If the "Size to be Sent"
Intent is set on an individual Message, it may influence path selection.

Specifying Application Intents is not mandatory. An application can specify any
combination of Application Intents. If specified, Application Intents are
defined as parameters passed to the Preconnection Object, and may influence the
Connection established from that Preconnection. If a Connection is cloned to
form a Connection Group, and associated Application Intents are cloned along
with the other transport parameters. Some Intents have also corresponding
Message Properties, similar to the properties in {{send-params}}.

Application Intents can be added to this interface as Transport Preferences with
the "Prefer" preference level.

#### Traffic Category

This Intent specifies what the application expect the dominating traffic
pattern to be.

Possible Category values are:

Query:
: Single request / response style workload, latency bound

Control:
: Long lasting low bandwidth control channel, not bandwidth bound

Stream:
: Stream of data with steady data rate

Bulk:
: Bulk transfer of large Messages, presumably bandwidth bound

The default is to not assume any particular traffic pattern. Most categories
suggest the use of other intents to further describe the traffic pattern
anticipated, e.g., the bulk category suggesting the use of the Message Size
intents or the stream category suggesting the Stream Bitrate and Duration
intents.

#### Size to be Sent / Received

This Intent specifies what the application expects the size of a transfer to be.
It is a numeric property and given in Bytes.

#### Duration

This Intent specifies what the application expects the lifetime of a transfer
to be. It is a numeric property and given in milliseconds.

#### Send / Receive Bit-rate

This Intent specifies what the application expects the bit-rate of a transfer to
be. It is a numeric property and given in Bytes per second.

#### Cost Preferences

This Intent describes what an application prefers regarding monetary costs,
e.g., whether it considers it acceptable to utilize limited data volume. It
provides hints to the transport system on how to handle trade-offs between cost
and performance or reliability. This Intent can also apply to an individual
Messages.

No Expense:
: Avoid transports associated with monetary cost

Optimize Cost:
: Prefer inexpensive transports and accept service degradation

Balance Cost:
: Use system policy to balance cost and other criteria

Ignore Cost:
: Ignore cost, choose transport solely based on other criteria

The default is "Balance Cost".

## Protocol Properties

The following protocol properties might be made available in addition to those
in {{protocol-props}}:

* Abort timeout to suggest to the Remote Endpoint: This numeric property
  specifies the timeout to propose to the Remote Endpoint. It is given in
  seconds. \[EDITOR'S NOTE: For discussion of this property, see
  https://github.com/taps-api/drafts/issues/109]

## Send Parameters

The following send parameters might be made available in addition to those
specified in {{send-params}}:

* Immediate:
  Immediate is a boolean property. If true, the caller prefers immediacy to
  efficient capacity usage for this Message. For example, this means that
  the Message should not be bundled with other
  Message into the same transmission by the underlying Protocol Stack.

* Send Bitrate:
  This numeric property in Bytes per second specifies at what
  bitrate the application wishes the Message to be sent. A transport supporting
  this feature will not exceed the requested Send Bitrate even if flow-control
  and congestion control allow higher bitrates. This helps to avid bursty
  traffic pattern on busy video streaming servers.

# Sample API definition in Go {#appendix-api-sketch}

concretely into a programming language, an API interface definition in Go is
available online at https://github.com/mami-project/postsocket.  Documentation
for this API -- an illustration of the documentation an application developer
would see for an instance of this interface - is available online at
